41143,Project Menu Module Access Configuration,Andres Eduardo Garcia Marquez,Closed,Is duplicate of #10091,"Dear Redmine Team,

I would like to propose an enhancement that would allow administrators to define which project menu modules are accessible to end users. Currently, modules such as ""Time Tracking,"" ""Gantt,"" and ""Calendar"" are enabled by default, which can overwhelm the user experience, especially in scenarios where end users only need access to request submission and tracking modules.

Implementing this feature would improve usability and streamline the workspace for users who require limited access, avoiding unnecessary distractions and simplifying their interaction with the platform.

Thank you for considering this request. I am available to discuss further details if needed.

Sincerely,"
41031,Include project identifier in List-Id header field of notification emails,Go MAEDA,Closed,Is duplicate of #13359,"I propose adding the project identifier to the @List-Id@ header field of notification emails. Currently, the @List-Id@ is based on the emission email address (@Setting.mail_from@). I want to change the List-Id to include both the project identifier and the emission email address.

The current notification email headers include the @X-Redmine-Project@ field, which contains the project identifier. However, widely used email services Gmail do not support filtering based on custom headers starting with @X-@. This makes it difficult to create filters based on the project.

By including the project identifier in the @List-Id@, users can utilize Gmail’s @list@ operator to create filters based on the project. This enhancement would improve the ability to organize and manage project-related emails in Gmail.


*Current Implementation:*
For an emission email address of @redmine@example.net@, the current List-Id is:

<pre>
List-Id: <redmine.example.net>
</pre>

*Proposed Implementation:*
For an emission email address of @redmine@example.net@ and a project identifier of @ecookbook@, the proposed List-Id is:

<pre>
List-Id: <ecookbook.redmine.example.net>
</pre>

*Backward Compatibility:*

Changing the @List-Id@ header field value will affect users who depend on the current format. To address this, we may need to add a new setting in Administration > Settings page allowing users to choose whether to include the project identifier in the List-Id. This ensures that existing workflows relying on the current List-Id format remain unaffected.

39218,Send 2FA security notifications asynchronously,Mischa The Evil,Closed,"Related to #38388, Is duplicate of #36005","Given what Jean-Philippe Lang wrote in #38388#note-2:
> In Redmine 4.2, security notifications seem to be sent synchronously, unlike other notifications that are sent later. It triggers a timeout when sending the notification from redmine.org.

It might be better if Redmine would send security notifications asynchronously too."
39047,Add description field for issue queries,Liane Hampe,Closed,Is duplicate of #9309,"It would be nice to have an issue query description field since sometimes it is difficult to name the description so that other users are able to fully understand it.

The text filed in the new query form could be provided with wikitoolbar and the possibility to reference or include a wiki page or other macros.   

The description could be rendered right below the query name and should also be available on gantt and calendar page.

39025,two performers for one task.,Roman Pat,Closed,Is duplicate of #12579,"Colleagues, please tell me. Is it possible to assign two performers to one task at the same time."
38682,Disable option to upload files in tickets,Rene Goral,Closed,Is duplicate of #8168,"I've installed the DMSF plugin and want this as the only module to handle files. So I disabled the files and documents module for every project. 
!clipboard-202306081822-tbavg.png!
But people are still able to upload files using the standard file upload. 
!clipboard-202306081822-a048c.png!
That's a bit confusing for the users and pretty hard to handle for me as an admin. In some projects I want to disable the possibility to upload files for a reason.
From my point of view if the modules are disabled users shouldn't be able to upload files. At least administrators should have the option to disable the ""classic"" file upload via administration center and/or per project."
38542,Better username completion in the editor,Hendrik Jaeger,Closed,Is duplicate of #13919,"Hi

in #38511 someone tried to highlight me but since my name is ""Hendrik Jäger"" and only this part is actually displayed, they chose the obvious but wrong highlight (at)Hendrik, which is not me but ""Hendrik Adam"" (I’m (at)henk).

It would be nice to have better completion for this. The mechanism for completing ticket numbers with the popup would be well suited but it would have to search for both login-names and real-names.

Thanks for considering!"
38541,Automatic deletion of unactivated accounts,Hendrik Jaeger,Closed,Is duplicate of #30998,"Hi

in the context of #38511 I noticed that even after one week my unactivated account @henk_test was not deleted but still waited for me to click the confirmation link.

I see a similar issue with my own redmine instance where registrations require administrator approval: I have to delete a lot of accounts registered by bots.

It would be great to have redmine expire unconfirmed/unactivated accounts after a configurable amount of time."
38355,カスタムフィールドにbyte数制限追加  Request for limitation of byte number to custom field,Ayako Matsuzawa,Closed,Copied to #38357,"現在カスタムフィールドには文字数制限が可能ですが、byte数制限をかけたく、ご検討お願いいたします。目的としては、社内の生産システムとの連携になります。

Currently, custom fields have limitation only for number of characters.
We would like you to add limitation of byte number for operation of redmine with our production system.

Japanese has full-width characters(2bytes) and half-width characters(1byte).

Thank you for your cooperation in advance."
38343,"Change the default notification option to ""Only for things I watch or I am assigned to""",Go MAEDA,Closed,"Related to #38238, Is duplicate of #39500","Currently, the default notification option of a user is ""Only for things I watch or I'm involved in"". This means that a user will receive notifications about issues of which the user is an author, assignee, or watcher. I think it would be better to change the default value to ""Only for things I watch or I am assigned to"". With the option, the user will receive notifications about issues of which the user is an assignee or watcher.

* ""Only for things I watch or I'm involved in"" (internal name is @only_my_events@): issues of which the user is an *author*, assignee, or watcher
* ""Only for things I watch or I am assigned to"" (internal name is @only_assigned@): issues of which the user is an assignee, or watcher

In Redmine 5.1, we will have ""Auto watch issues on issue creation"" feature (#38238). Since the new feature is enabled by default for newly created users, new users in Redmine 5.1 automatically become a watcher of issues they create. Becoming an issue watcher automatically means that the user will always receive notifications for issues they create even if the user's notification option is set to ""only_assigned"". Whether the setting is ""only_my_events"" or ""only_assigned"", the type of notifications received will be the same.

Given that ""only_my_events"" and ""only_assigned"" behave the same when the user's settings are left at their defaults, I think it would be better to change the default setting for email notifications (@Setting.default_notification_option@) from ""only_my_events"" to ""only_assigned"" because of the following reasons:

* Users can stop notifications of issues they created by unwatching those issues. This fulfills feature requests such as #6914 and #27135
* The behavior is confusing if ""Auto watch issues on issue creation"" is enabled and the notification setting is ""only my events"". The user will assume that the reason they receive notifications about issues they created is that they watch the issues. And if they want to stop receiving notifications, they will unwatch the issue. However, unwatching will not stop notifications when the notification setting is ""only_my_events"".

38255,Filter free and paid plugins in the plugin directory,Vendel Czinder,Closed,Is duplicate of #17689,"Hi all,

there are numerous plugins in the plugin directory that are either demo or trial versions or otherwise limited, pushing the users to buy the full (paid) version of the plugins.
I have no grudge against them as these are also great and well supported software, but finding open-source and free plugins really gets cumbersome because of them.

My proposal: create tags and/or categories (or similar) for all the plugins and create filtering based on this information. (maybe like the compatible Redmine version dropdown)

Thank you for considering my proposal, please feel free to comment, and if I can help in any way, I'll try. (although I  have a very limited understanding of the technical workings of this system).
If I've opened my issue at the wrong spot, feel free to point me in the right direction. 

Thank you,

38173,"Increase limit of entries in json/xml and, preferably, make it configurable",Sergey Naumov,Closed,Related to #16069,"Currently there is a limit on how many entries could be returned by JSON/XML API in one batch - 100 entries. This limit is hardcoded in Redmine core. Such a low limit makes requests to Redmine to be affected by RTT + it could put more load on DB. 

The question is why this limit it not set to at least 500 (the default value for number of entries exported via CSV export API). Could this limit be made configurable just like for CSV?"
37717,"""Show completed versions"" by default",thuruk thuruk,Closed,Is duplicate of #13670,"It would be useful not only to be able to show completed versions by default, but to separate _closed_ versions from _completed_ versions.
In my case, we put out versions at irregular intervals so we can have a version that's completed, but won't come out for a few weeks. In the meantime, I have to click ""Show completed versions"" everytime I want to see it, and I get _all_ versions, including the closed ones."

37365,Allow users to choose textile or markdown formatting,Christian Kay,Closed,"Related to #34863, Is duplicate of #8095","Currently you can only set the the Text formatting to Textile or Markdown globally. You can't manually select what you prefer at user/issue/project base.

Additionally upgrading from Textile to Markdown is error prone and at some size it is not manageable to manually fix the caused problems due conversion (Reformat plugin).
So there is no reasonable way to convert from textile to markdown. 
Even then long term users might insist that they are used to textile and they do not know markdown (ofc there is a workaround, learning a new syntax).

Please add the possibility to choose the formatting at user/issue/project base.
Without the option a transition from textile to markdown is pretty impossible (old stuff could keep textile, new stuff markdown)."

35685,Support for MySQL > 5.7 or MariaDB,Martin Jungowski,Closed,"Related to #39437, Related to #19395","Given that I cannot see anything on the roadmap I'd like to ask what the state of MySQL support is. As stated on the Install page the latest officially supported release is MySQL 5.6, which has been EOL since February of 2021. MySQL 5.7 seems to work just fine but is not yet officially supported (it's on the roadmap for the next major release after 5.0!) and has an EOL date of October 2023 (aka slightly over 2 years from today). At the current speed of development I fear that MySQL will be EOL long before it is officially supported by Redmine. MariaDB is not supported at all.

I'll try to explain the feature with my real life example. 
One day person came and asked me to create a project for him, so I duplicated a template for him and all fine. The problem is: now when I click in ""My Page"", it shows to me the issues related to that project which I don't care and I also used to receive e-mails from it (not sure if the e-mail is still being sent after Redmine 4).
So, what I imagine, is a simple way on the settings of selecting another person to be the responsible one, maybe a checkbox similar to adding member to a project. I imagine that this information is stored somewhere.

33612,Expose repository version via REST API,Tom Quern,Closed,Is duplicate of #5901,"For Redmine clients interacting with different versions of the Redmine server it would be beneficial to have an easy way to identify the server version. Currently this information is available in the web UI: <your-host>/admin/info and can be scrapped from the page (e.g. with Jsoup), but it's a hack.

Please, add possibility to configure limit used to retrieve objects for an API response.

33479,Make other destinations visible in the Redmine notification email,Yuuki NARA,Closed,Is duplicate of #30787,"Make other destinations visible in the Redmine notification email

h1. Proposal

In Redmine4.0, other destinations are no longer displayed in the notification email.

This is a side effect of the following changes in Redmine 4.0.
https://redmine.org/issues/26791

Depending on the contents of the ticket, it may be necessary to confirm who is notified.
For example, the response may change depending on whether the trouble ticket content is delivered to the CEO.

In Redmine3.4, it was found from the To / Cc column of the notification email that the email was sent to someone else.
In Redmine 4.0 or later, you can not understand without checking the ticket.

Also, the amount sent to the person who has been set to ""notify all"" in the personal settings cannot be confirmed on the ticket.

h1. Solution

There is no problem in sending individual emails.
The only inconvenience is that you can no longer check the simultaneous notification destination directly from the email.

It seems that the conventional To / Cc (watch) can be added to the beginning of the email text by setting the individual ID unit.

h1. Supplement

In Redmine3.X, there was a side effect that other destinations could be known by batch mailing. (Specification changed in 4.0)
It seems that it was not recognized that there were cases where this was used as a substantial function.
(In some cases, it may be necessary to respond depending on the email notification destination)

You can tell by checking the ticket from the link on the notification email, but it will be a burden if there are many cases.

Redmine4.0以降ではチケットを確認しないと判らない。

また、個人設定で「すべて通知」にしている人への送信分は、チケット上から確認できない。

■解決策
メールの個別送信自体には問題ない。
同時通知先をメールから直接確認できなくなったのが不便なだけ。

個人ID単位の設定により、従来のTo/Cc(watch) をメールテキスト先頭に付けられれば良いと思われる。

■補足
Redmine3.Xでは、メール一括送信により他の送信先が判るという副作用があった。（4.0で仕様変更）
これを実質的な機能として利用している場合があったことが、認識されていなかったと思われる。
（メール通知先により対応必要なケースもある）

通知メール上のリンクからチケットを確認すれば判るが、件数が多ければ負担になる。

Just a thought - the right hand panel in the views mentioned above are given far too much real estate for the data they contains.

For example when I'm in the Issues view 1/3 of the screen is given to the right hand panel yet it only contains 3 small links and the rest of the panel is unused and coloured grey.

Better sizing can make better use of this portion of the window.

I've attached a screen grab to give as an example.

I use a MAC and it's the same in Safari and FF.

32491,Watcher can see tickets independent from issue visibility,Martina A.,Closed,Is duplicate of #23546,"Hello Redmine Team,

we would need the following configuration option: 
In our projects, our members have the issue visibility ""Issues created by or assigned to the user"".
This is set by default, due to GDPR and internal reasons.

For some cases, we would need to allow watchers to see the issue and also be informed via E-Mail about changes. But with above issue visibility this is not possible. We can add watchers, but of course, they do not see the issue.

In contrast, setting the issue visibility to ""All non private issues"" would allow them to see too much tickets.

So a combination would be great: general setting for visibility is ""Issues created by or assigned to the user"" but with the exceptional case, if a person is assigned as watcher.
It should be possible, that the watcher can see those issues, he has been added to.

Thanks in advance."

We should add a separator between the history list and the item action buttons.

To reproduce: 

* Add a one line Note to an issue and save it.
* look at the delete buttons a the bottom right corner of the page.

26709,Use correct http status codes,Pavel Rosický,Closed,Is duplicate of #34766,"1/ redmine ignores accept headers and jquery dataType attribute

The Accept request-header field can be used to specify certain media types which are acceptable for the response.

If no Accept header field is present, then it is assumed that the client accepts all media types. If an Accept header field is present, and if the server cannot send a response which is acceptable according to the combined Accept field value, then the server SHOULD send a 406 (not acceptable) response.

http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/

The type of data that you're expecting back from the server. If none is specified, jQuery will try to infer it based on the MIME type of the response (an XML MIME type will yield XML, in 1.4 JSON will yield a JavaScript object, in 1.4 script will execute the script, and anything else will be returned as a string). The available types (and the result passed as the first argument to your success callback)

25454,Add bulk edit after save hook,Serghei Zagorinyak,Closed,Is duplicate of #8757,"Correct me if I'm mistaken, but now there only exists a @issue_bulk_edit_before_save@ controller hook. This makes it impossible to provide consistent behavior for plugins implementing edit_after_save controller hooks.

Say, a user edits an issue via issue view and triggers a @issue_edit_after_save_hook@ which handles the issue in a proper way. The same is expected to happen when an issue is edited via context menu (right click) in any multiple issues view, but there is no way to provide that as @bulk_edit@ method is called for context menus and there is no @issue_bulk_edit_after_save@ hook which makes @issue_edit_after_save@ hook useless.

I think it would be useful to have something like this in issues#bulk_edit controller method:

<pre>
def bulk_edit
  ...
  @issues.each do |orig_issue|
    ...

    begin        
      Issue.transaction do

        issue.save!

I think it might be more sensible to hide the projects the user is not a regular team member of.
We use Redmine in our organisation and have currenty 90 projects.
There are several admins assigned via the LDAP attribute and it works quite fine.

Though, if the number of projects increases, the project overview page renders quite useless because you will effectively be unable to find your projects.
Ok, the own projects are highlighted by a little yellow star. But I think it might be quite helpful to hide the projects I have administrative access to per default and show these on demand.

Maybe I can assist you on implementing this behaviour but I need a advise where to start from.
Organisations and companies with a large user base and an elaborated project structure might be very grateful.

24529,"change sort order for due date column on ""Issues assigned"" page",Jesús M. Navarro,Closed,Is duplicate of #6034,"As per message#49589, I'd want to see either default date sorting changed or the ability to set it on-demand.

If I'm requesting issues to be sorted by due date, it means due date is of importance to me, so issues with an assigned due date should be somehow highlighted over those without (i.e.: by sorting before).

Not having an assigned due date on an issue means I don't know/it doesn't matter and, again, known info should prevail over _""don't knows/doesn't matters""_.

Excluding in the query issues without due date may make sense sometimes but I can think of a lot of scenarios when it doesn't (i.e.: multifilter: I still want to see issues at critical priority sorted before any issues at normal priority, even if no due date is assigned to them).
An issue can have an implicit due date as long it has a target version assigned (that of the target version).

I can't think of an user case where things with no due date should be meaningfully presented before those with a due date when sorting ascending order.

So, in sorting by due date (ascending), I would expect issues sorted like this:
* 1/MAR/2016
* 2/MAR/2016
* no due date [or have it set to its target version's one and sort accordingly]

23216,"Issues List, Enhanced Filtering - Allowing Multiple Queries & ""OR""-type constraints",James H,Closed,"Is duplicate of #4939, Is duplicate of #10999","Some of our biggest ""problems"" that causes us to look elsewhere for a solution are:

* there is no way to use an ""OR"" clause.
* there is no good way to search for multiple issues (its possible to select multiple trackers, statuses, etc. but it is not possible to select multiple subjects nor is it possible to define separate filters per selected filter (e.g. different assignee for each selected tracker) and other similar use cases).

-------

One proposed solution:
I think one of the ""more simple"" methods of adding this feature would be to add a way to define multiple sets of ""queries""/filters in one search:

Ex. you need to search for two types of issues at once. Tracker A that are assigned to Paul and Tracker B that are assigned to John. You need to see both of these side-by-side to be able to compare the due dates between the two and take action as needed.
You define your first ""query""/filter by filtering for Tracker: ""A"" and Assigned to: ""Paul"". After that, you click a ""+"" icon below the filter/options that adds another set of filter/options and you can define your second ""query""/filter by setting Tracker: ""B"" and Assigned to: ""John"". Click apply and it will run both queries, distinct & union the result set and display accordingly. The displayed columns would be shared between all issues.

This could also lead into some sort of combined custom query searching capability if that is something you guys want to explore.
