Tracker A that are assigned to Paul and Tracker B that are assigned to John. You need to see both of these side-by-side to be able to compare the due dates between the two and take action as needed.\r\nYou define your first \"query\"/filter by filtering for Tracker: \"A\" and Assigned to: \"Paul\". After that, you click a \"+\" icon below the filter/options that adds another set of filter/options and you can define your second \"query\"/filter by setting Tracker: \"B\" and Assigned to: \"John\". Click apply and it will run both queries, distinct & union the result set and display accordingly. The displayed columns would be shared between all issues.\r\n\r\nThis could also lead into some sort of combined custom query searching capability if that is something you guys want to explore.\r\n\r\n----"}]}}

In Redmine core, this only affects the security notifications.\r\n* Depending on the number of recipients for a notification, there might be many rendered mails which can take some time in the request. To ensure a snappy response, we can use ActiveJob to render and send the mails in the background. This can make the @async_*@ delivery methods obsolete.\r\n\r\nh2. Reminder: How mail sending works in plain Rails (and Redmine)\r\n\r\nThis patch series changes how mails are generated and delivered. Let's first look at how a mail normally gets generated and delivered in ActionMailer.\r\n\r\n* @mail = Mailer.news_added(news)@ - The user calls a class-method of the Mailer class (a child-class of ActionMailer::Base). This method is usually not implemented in the @Mailer@ class itself. Instead, there is a \"@method_missing@\":https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v5.1.2/actionmailer/lib/action_mailer/base.rb#L576-L582 method on @ActionMailer::Base@. Here, ActionMailer creates a @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object. Which is basically a delegator to an _eventually rendered_ mail object. Now, the mail is not actually rendered here. The @MessageDelivery@ object only collects all arguments it needs to eventually render the mail. This happens implicitly when any method on the mail is accessed (e.g. when the mail is about to be delivered). The @MessageDelivery@ delegator is returned to the user.\r\n\r\nNow that we have the (delegated) mail, we can deliver it with @mail.deliver@. This method used to be the only delivery method. With newer Rails versions, there is (with some variations) @deliver_now@ and @deliver_later@. Redmine usually calls @deliver@ which in source:trunk/config/initializers/10-patches.rb#L160 calls @deliver_now@ currently.\r\n\r\nWhen calling @mail.deliver@, the delegator starts to render the mail:\r\n\r\n* \"@MessageDelivery#processed_mailer@\":https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v5.1.3/actionmailer/lib/action_mailer/message_delivery.rb#L103-L107 creates a new @Mailer@ instance and calls @process@ on it.\r\n* @Mailer#process(:news_added, news)@ - The @process@ method is part of ActionMailer (and in turn part of the @ActionController@ framework on which ActionMailer is based on). Among things, it calls the specified action, i.e. the instance method.\r\n* @Mailer#news_added(news)@ - This instance method is implemented on the Mailer class and is responsible to render the actual mail message. Here, we set headers, instance variables for the view and basically do the usual controller stuff. With a final call to @mail@, we eventually render a single mail and return a @Mail::Message@ object.\r\n* This returned @Mail::Message@ object is delivered with a call to @Mail::Message#deliver_now@.\r\n\r\nh2. How we hook into this process\r\n\r\nNow, in order to send multiple mails, we hook into this process to render (and deliver) multiple mails. We want to ensure two things:\r\n\r\n* We want to create multiple mails, one per recipient and deliver them all in one go.\r\n* When rendering the mail (i.e. when calling the Mailer's instance method), we want to set @User.current@ to the recipient user and set it back to the original value after the rendering is done\r\n\r\nThese two goals are achieved with two specific changes to our Mailer:\r\n\r\nWe introduce a wrapper class called @Mailer::MultiMessage@. Instances of this class wrap multiple @Mail::Message@ objects (or rather @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ objects which delegate to @Mail::Message@ objects). The class provides the same @deliver_*@ methods as the original @Mail::Message@ objects. When calling such a method, we are calling it on each of the wrapped messages. This allows us to use an instance of this class in place of a @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object.\r\n\r\nWe use this class by implementing _class methods_ for each mailer action. These class methods implement the same external interface (i.e. accept the same arguments) as the old instance methods. This ensures that we keep the existing public interface. The class methods fetch the recipient users for the respective object (i.e. the issue, news, comment, ...). We use @Mailer::MultiMessage#for@ to add an @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object for each recipient which eventually renders the mail.\r\n\r\nWhen creating the delegator, we also pass the recipient user to the arguments for the mail rendering. We use this user in the overwritten @Mailer#process@ method to set @User.current@ and their language before actually rendering the message. This convention allows us to keep the interfaces clear: the user is only passed between the class method and @Mailer#process@ but doesn't need to be specified on the instance action. Here, it is already set as @User.current@ for each rendered mail.\r\n\r\nWe also extend @Mailer.method_missing@ (on the class) to create a single-mail @Mailer::MultiMessage@ object with the current user in case the class method for an action is not explicitly overwritten. This ensures that our convention of always passing a user to @Mailer#process@ is kept up even if a plugin only adds an instance method (which was valid before).\r\n\r\nh2. What we tried and did not work\r\n\r\nI first attempted to set the current user directly in the action's class method. and reset it directly afterwards. That would have made the code much more localized. However, due to the delayed rendering of the mail with the @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object, the mail will be rendered only after we have already reset the current user.\r\n\r\nOne way to work around this would be to introduce @deliver_*@ methods (like the now obsolete @Mailer.deliver_issue_add@ method). However doing so would have changed the intended external interface of our @Mailer@ class and would likely lead to integration pain with all existing Redmine plugins sending mail.\r\n\r\nh2. What we ship\r\n\r\nWe ship three patches here:\r\n\r\n* @0001-Send-individual-emails-for-each-mail-recipient.patch@ - The main implementation including tests.\r\n* @0002-Cleanup-Remove-Issue-each_notification-and-Journal-e.patch@ - Removes unneccessary methods for grouping recipients based on custom field visibility\r\n* @0003-Optional-Ensure-that-ActiveRecord-Base-objects-are-f.patch@ - An optional patch which changes the serialization behavior when sending mails with ActiveJob (e.g. with @Mailer.news_added(news).deliver_later@). By default, Rails serialized the arguments as a globalid (which is basically a reference to the object in the database identified by its ID). If there are concurrent changes to e.g. a newly created issue, this might result in notifications using the new state instead of the original state. With this patch, we serialize the exact attributes of the given objects into the job. Since this also causes nested attributes to be serialized along, care must be taken to avoid reference errors. In general, we should probably try to use mostly immutable state in the database where it is an important consideration that the notification state is exactly shown in the DB.\r\n\r\nh2. Future work\r\n\r\nh3. ActiveJob sending\r\n\r\nIf the general direction of this patch is accepted, it is probably desireable to move the mail sending to ActiveJob completely. This could replace the @async_*@ delivery methods [[EmailConfiguration#Asynchronous-delivery_methods|currently configurable]] in @configuration.yml@. This change can either be hardcoded in source:trunk/config/initializers/10-patches.rb#L160 or made configurable with a setting. I'll be glad to provide a patch for this. It would only be a few lines of code.\r\n\r\nBy default, we could use the in-process ActiveJob runner to send mails. More advanced users with a dedicated job worker (e.g. delayed job) can easily switch to that without changes to the Redmine code itself.\r\n\r\nh3. BCC recipients\r\n\r\nSince each user gets their own mail, we can probably remove the setting to send mails with BCC completely. If plugins want to send mails to non-user recipients, we would have to make sure to either set the recipients manually on BCC or group them appropriately. It is not a required setting in Redmine core anymore though.\n\n-- Ticket2\n--Subject--\nImmediately send a notify email when a user is added to issue's watcher list\n\n--Description--\nHi, Jean-Philippe, it is a great feature that you add the watcher list to the issue. By this feature, we are now able to select the members who should receive notify email about an issue.\r\n\r\nBut I think it would be more useful that redmine could send a issue's summary info to the watcher when he is added to the list. Do you think so?"}]}}

Instead, there is a \"@method_missing@\":https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v5.1.2/actionmailer/lib/action_mailer/base.rb#L576-L582 method on @ActionMailer::Base@. Here, ActionMailer creates a @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object. Which is basically a delegator to an _eventually rendered_ mail object. Now, the mail is not actually rendered here. The @MessageDelivery@ object only collects all arguments it needs to eventually render the mail. This happens implicitly when any method on the mail is accessed (e.g. when the mail is about to be delivered). The @MessageDelivery@ delegator is returned to the user.\r\n\r\nNow that we have the (delegated) mail, we can deliver it with @mail.deliver@. This method used to be the only delivery method. With newer Rails versions, there is (with some variations) @deliver_now@ and @deliver_later@. Redmine usually calls @deliver@ which in source:trunk/config/initializers/10-patches.rb#L160 calls @deliver_now@ currently.\r\n\r\nWhen calling @mail.deliver@, the delegator starts to render the mail:\r\n\r\n* \"@MessageDelivery#processed_mailer@\":https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v5.1.3/actionmailer/lib/action_mailer/message_delivery.rb#L103-L107 creates a new @Mailer@ instance and calls @process@ on it.\r\n* @Mailer#process(:news_added, news)@ - The @process@ method is part of ActionMailer (and in turn part of the @ActionController@ framework on which ActionMailer is based on). Among things, it calls the specified action, i.e. the instance method.\r\n* @Mailer#news_added(news)@ - This instance method is implemented on the Mailer class and is responsible to render the actual mail message. Here, we set headers, instance variables for the view and basically do the usual controller stuff. With a final call to @mail@, we eventually render a single mail and return a @Mail::Message@ object.\r\n* This returned @Mail::Message@ object is delivered with a call to @Mail::Message#deliver_now@.\r\n\r\nh2. How we hook into this process\r\n\r\nNow, in order to send multiple mails, we hook into this process to render (and deliver) multiple mails. We want to ensure two things:\r\n\r\n* We want to create multiple mails, one per recipient and deliver them all in one go.\r\n* When rendering the mail (i.e. when calling the Mailer's instance method), we want to set @User.current@ to the recipient user and set it back to the original value after the rendering is done\r\n\r\nThese two goals are achieved with two specific changes to our Mailer:\r\n\r\nWe introduce a wrapper class called @Mailer::MultiMessage@. Instances of this class wrap multiple @Mail::Message@ objects (or rather @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ objects which delegate to @Mail::Message@ objects). The class provides the same @deliver_*@ methods as the original @Mail::Message@ objects. When calling such a method, we are calling it on each of the wrapped messages. This allows us to use an instance of this class in place of a @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object.\r\n\r\nWe use this class by implementing _class methods_ for each mailer action. These class methods implement the same external interface (i.e. accept the same arguments) as the old instance methods. This ensures that we keep the existing public interface. The class methods fetch the recipient users for the respective object (i.e. the issue, news, comment, ...). We use @Mailer::MultiMessage#for@ to add an @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object for each recipient which eventually renders the mail.\r\n\r\nWhen creating the delegator, we also pass the recipient user to the arguments for the mail rendering. We use this user in the overwritten @Mailer#process@ method to set @User.current@ and their language before actually rendering the message. This convention allows us to keep the interfaces clear: the user is only passed between the class method and @Mailer#process@ but doesn't need to be specified on the instance action. Here, it is already set as @User.current@ for each rendered mail.\r\n\r\nWe also extend @Mailer.method_missing@ (on the class) to create a single-mail @Mailer::MultiMessage@ object with the current user in case the class method for an action is not explicitly overwritten. This ensures that our convention of always passing a user to @Mailer#process@ is kept up even if a plugin only adds an instance method (which was valid before).\r\n\r\nh2. What we tried and did not work\r\n\r\nI first attempted to set the current user directly in the action's class method. and reset it directly afterwards. That would have made the code much more localized. However, due to the delayed rendering of the mail with the @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object, the mail will be rendered only after we have already reset the current user.\r\n\r\nOne way to work around this would be to introduce @deliver_*@ methods (like the now obsolete @Mailer.deliver_issue_add@ method). However doing so would have changed the intended external interface of our @Mailer@ class and would likely lead to integration pain with all existing Redmine plugins sending mail.\r\n\r\nh2. What we ship\r\n\r\nWe ship three patches here:\r\n\r\n* @0001-Send-individual-emails-for-each-mail-recipient.patch@ - The main implementation including tests.\r\n* @0002-Cleanup-Remove-Issue-each_notification-and-Journal-e.patch@ - Removes unneccessary methods for grouping recipients based on custom field visibility\r\n* @0003-Optional-Ensure-that-ActiveRecord-Base-objects-are-f.patch@ - An optional patch which changes the serialization behavior when sending mails with ActiveJob (e.g. with @Mailer.news_added(news).deliver_later@). By default, Rails serialized the arguments as a globalid (which is basically a reference to the object in the database identified by its ID). If there are concurrent changes to e.g. a newly created issue, this might result in notifications using the new state instead of the original state. With this patch, we serialize the exact attributes of the given objects into the job. Since this also causes nested attributes to be serialized along, care must be taken to avoid reference errors. In general, we should probably try to use mostly immutable state in the database where it is an important consideration that the notification state is exactly shown in the DB.\r\n\r\nh2. Future work\r\n\r\nh3. ActiveJob sending\r\n\r\nIf the general direction of this patch is accepted, it is probably desireable to move the mail sending to ActiveJob completely. This could replace the @async_*@ delivery methods [[EmailConfiguration#Asynchronous-delivery_methods|currently configurable]] in @configuration.yml@. This change can either be hardcoded in source:trunk/config/initializers/10-patches.rb#L160 or made configurable with a setting. I'll be glad to provide a patch for this. It would only be a few lines of code.\r\n\r\nBy default, we could use the in-process ActiveJob runner to send mails. More advanced users with a dedicated job worker (e.g. delayed job) can easily switch to that without changes to the Redmine code itself.\r\n\r\nh3. BCC recipients\r\n\r\nSince each user gets their own mail, we can probably remove the setting to send mails with BCC completely. If plugins want to send mails to non-user recipients, we would have to make sure to either set the recipients manually on BCC or group them appropriately. It is not a required setting in Redmine core anymore though.\n\n-- Ticket2\n--Subject--\nAdd project identifier to List-Id header in notification emails for better Gmail filtering\n\n--Description--\nThis gives the possibility to filer mail-updates from different project into different folders.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n--- ./redmine-2.1.6/app/models/mailer.rb        2013-01-09 17:34:07.000000000 +0100\r\n+++ /opt/redmine-2.1.6/app/models/mailer.rb     2013-03-05 15:33:38.438398984 +0100\r\n@@ -386,7 +386,7 @@\r\n             'X-Auto-Response-Suppress' => 'OOF',\r\n             'Auto-Submitted' => 'auto-generated',\r\n             'From' => Setting.mail_from,\r\n-            'List-Id' => \"<#{Setting.mail_from.to_s.gsub('@', '.')}>\"\r\n+            'List-Id' => \"<#{@issue.project.identifier}.#{Setting.host_name}>\"\r\n\r\n     # Removes the author from the recipients and cc\r\n     # if he doesn't want to receive notifications about what he does\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThe resulting List-Id could look like this:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nList-Id: <cantemo-ab.vvv.cantemo.com>\r\n</pre>"}]}}

Specifically, we are sending one mail per recipient user. Each of those mails is rendered in the context of the recipient (i.e. with @User.current@ set to the recipient). The mails can be sent immediately or optionally delayed using ActiveJob.\r\n\r\nThis approach has a couple of advantages over the existing approach of sending a single mail to multiple recipients:\r\n\r\n* We ensure object visibility for the rendered mails in the most generic way. Since each mail is rendered with @User.current@ set to the recipient, all content rendered in the mail (including shown issue attributes, macros and links in rendered textile text, ...) is guaranteed to only be visible to the user without having to ensure this manually for each mail using the same visibility rules as used for the HTML views already.\r\n* The mail will always be sent in the recipients language, even if multiple users with different languages are notified\r\n* There is no risk of the whole notification mail being rejected because of a single invalid recipient address (see #8157, #6829, #8733 and a lot of duplicates)\r\n\r\nIn the long run, it will also allow us to introduce user-specific additional information in the rendered notification, e.g. related issues, links to assign the issue, ...\r\n\r\nWith this new approach, we do have a some challenges which we are trying to address separately:\r\n\r\n* Since each mail is always rendered with an adapted @User.current@, any mail views which expected to use the original @User.current@ need to be adapted. In Redmine core, this only affects the security notifications.\r\n* Depending on the number of recipients for a notification, there might be many rendered mails which can take some time in the request. To ensure a snappy response, we can use ActiveJob to render and send the mails in the background. This can make the @async_*@ delivery methods obsolete.\r\n\r\nh2. Reminder: How mail sending works in plain Rails (and Redmine)\r\n\r\nThis patch series changes how mails are generated and delivered. Let's first look at how a mail normally gets generated and delivered in ActionMailer.\r\n\r\n* @mail = Mailer.news_added(news)@ - The user calls a class-method of the Mailer class (a child-class of ActionMailer::Base). This method is usually not implemented in the @Mailer@ class itself. Instead, there is a \"@method_missing@\":https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v5.1.2/actionmailer/lib/action_mailer/base.rb#L576-L582 method on @ActionMailer::Base@. Here, ActionMailer creates a @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object. Which is basically a delegator to an _eventually rendered_ mail object. Now, the mail is not actually rendered here. The @MessageDelivery@ object only collects all arguments it needs to eventually render the mail. This happens implicitly when any method on the mail is accessed (e.g. when the mail is about to be delivered). The @MessageDelivery@ delegator is returned to the user.\r\n\r\nNow that we have the (delegated) mail, we can deliver it with @mail.deliver@. This method used to be the only delivery method. With newer Rails versions, there is (with some variations) @deliver_now@ and @deliver_later@. Redmine usually calls @deliver@ which in source:trunk/config/initializers/10-patches.rb#L160 calls @deliver_now@ currently.\r\n\r\nWhen calling @mail.deliver@, the delegator starts to render the mail:\r\n\r\n* \"@MessageDelivery#processed_mailer@\":https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v5.1.3/actionmailer/lib/action_mailer/message_delivery.rb#L103-L107 creates a new @Mailer@ instance and calls @process@ on it.\r\n* @Mailer#process(:news_added, news)@ - The @process@ method is part of ActionMailer (and in turn part of the @ActionController@ framework on which ActionMailer is based on). Among things, it calls the specified action, i.e. the instance method.\r\n* @Mailer#news_added(news)@ - This instance method is implemented on the Mailer class and is responsible to render the actual mail message. Here, we set headers, instance variables for the view and basically do the usual controller stuff. With a final call to @mail@, we eventually render a single mail and return a @Mail::Message@ object.\r\n* This returned @Mail::Message@ object is delivered with a call to @Mail::Message#deliver_now@.\r\n\r\nh2. How we hook into this process\r\n\r\nNow, in order to send multiple mails, we hook into this process to render (and deliver) multiple mails. We want to ensure two things:\r\n\r\n* We want to create multiple mails, one per recipient and deliver them all in one go.\r\n* When rendering the mail (i.e. when calling the Mailer's instance method), we want to set @User.current@ to the recipient user and set it back to the original value after the rendering is done\r\n\r\nThese two goals are achieved with two specific changes to our Mailer:\r\n\r\nWe introduce a wrapper class called @Mailer::MultiMessage@. Instances of this class wrap multiple @Mail::Message@ objects (or rather @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ objects which delegate to @Mail::Message@ objects). The class provides the same @deliver_*@ methods as the original @Mail::Message@ objects. When calling such a method, we are calling it on each of the wrapped messages. This allows us to use an instance of this class in place of a @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object.\r\n\r\nWe use this class by implementing _class methods_ for each mailer action. These class methods implement the same external interface (i.e. accept the same arguments) as the old instance methods. This ensures that we keep the existing public interface. The class methods fetch the recipient users for the respective object (i.e. the issue, news, comment, ...). We use @Mailer::MultiMessage#for@ to add an @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object for each recipient which eventually renders the mail.\r\n\r\nWhen creating the delegator, we also pass the recipient user to the arguments for the mail rendering. We use this user in the overwritten @Mailer#process@ method to set @User.current@ and their language before actually rendering the message. This convention allows us to keep the interfaces clear: the user is only passed between the class method and @Mailer#process@ but doesn't need to be specified on the instance action. Here, it is already set as @User.current@ for each rendered mail.\r\n\r\nWe also extend @Mailer.method_missing@ (on the class) to create a single-mail @Mailer::MultiMessage@ object with the current user in case the class method for an action is not explicitly overwritten. This ensures that our convention of always passing a user to @Mailer#process@ is kept up even if a plugin only adds an instance method (which was valid before).\r\n\r\nh2. What we tried and did not work\r\n\r\nI first attempted to set the current user directly in the action's class method. and reset it directly afterwards. That would have made the code much more localized. However, due to the delayed rendering of the mail with the @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object, the mail will be rendered only after we have already reset the current user.\r\n\r\nOne way to work around this would be to introduce @deliver_*@ methods (like the now obsolete @Mailer.deliver_issue_add@ method). However doing so would have changed the intended external interface of our @Mailer@ class and would likely lead to integration pain with all existing Redmine plugins sending mail.\r\n\r\nh2. What we ship\r\n\r\nWe ship three patches here:\r\n\r\n* @0001-Send-individual-emails-for-each-mail-recipient.patch@ - The main implementation including tests.\r\n* @0002-Cleanup-Remove-Issue-each_notification-and-Journal-e.patch@ - Removes unneccessary methods for grouping recipients based on custom field visibility\r\n* @0003-Optional-Ensure-that-ActiveRecord-Base-objects-are-f.patch@ - An optional patch which changes the serialization behavior when sending mails with ActiveJob (e.g. with @Mailer.news_added(news).deliver_later@). By default, Rails serialized the arguments as a globalid (which is basically a reference to the object in the database identified by its ID). If there are concurrent changes to e.g. a newly created issue, this might result in notifications using the new state instead of the original state. With this patch, we serialize the exact attributes of the given objects into the job. Since this also causes nested attributes to be serialized along, care must be taken to avoid reference errors. In general, we should probably try to use mostly immutable state in the database where it is an important consideration that the notification state is exactly shown in the DB.\r\n\r\nh2. Future work\r\n\r\nh3. ActiveJob sending\r\n\r\nIf the general direction of this patch is accepted, it is probably desireable to move the mail sending to ActiveJob completely. This could replace the @async_*@ delivery methods [[EmailConfiguration#Asynchronous-delivery_methods|currently configurable]] in @configuration.yml@. This change can either be hardcoded in source:trunk/config/initializers/10-patches.rb#L160 or made configurable with a setting. I'll be glad to provide a patch for this. It would only be a few lines of code.\r\n\r\nBy default, we could use the in-process ActiveJob runner to send mails. More advanced users with a dedicated job worker (e.g. delayed job) can easily switch to that without changes to the Redmine code itself.\r\n\r\nh3. BCC recipients\r\n\r\nSince each user gets their own mail, we can probably remove the setting to send mails with BCC completely. If plugins want to send mails to non-user recipients, we would have to make sure to either set the recipients manually on BCC or group them appropriately. It is not a required setting in Redmine core anymore though.\n\n-- Ticket2\n--Subject--\ndefault sort email reminders by due date (and list due date in email)\n\n--Description--\nI think this should be default behavior.  I've already written the code to do this, but I'm not sure how to get the code to you since the [contribute](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Contribute) page says not to use pull requests.  What is the preferred method of getting the code to you on github?  I see the link to creating patches on git, but I didn't really follow it.  Can someone give me a more detailed explanation?\r\n\r\nI uploaded a file of what our email reminders look like now after the changes."}]}}

But I would be very happy with the ability to watch all activity associated with specified target versions.\r\n\r\nThanks"}]}}

It can happen, for example, when a customer send a problem via email and we need to create a Redmine issue ourself, and give this customer access to the ticket.\r\n\r\nI asked Jean-Phillipe on #7412#note-2 to extend the visibility of an issue to observers, and some people liked it, but it was not done because observe mechanism was designed for notification purposes (I now I agree it is not good, that's why I'm creating this feature request).\r\n\r\nSo my request is:\r\nCreate a involve mechanism where some roles can add people in an issue, in a very similar way they add an observer, and the added users have access to the issue the were involved."}]}}

Thank you so much.\r\n\n\n-- Ticket2\n--Subject--\nAllow assigning issues and/or watcher status to authenticated non members\n\n--Description--\nThis feature request is vaguely similar to #7342 but that issue doesn't particularly fulfill this request.\r\n\r\nOur redmine installation is configured to require authentication for access and for manual account activation for self registered accounts.\r\n\r\nSince we require authentication for access, most projects on this system are configured as public and the Non member role set to permit view access and edit to forum, issue tracking, wiki, etc. This was done to allow all within the organization to have limited access to all public projects and was working as expected.\r\n\r\nBut while the majority of the activity within a project is accomplished by the active members of the project team who are all assigned to the project and associated with some role, it is not uncommon for an issue to require action by someone who is not a direct member of the team however, unless a user is actually a member of a project, as Non members they cannot be assigned tasks or designated as watchers.\r\n\r\nAs a work around, we have an 'Associated' role cloned from the Non member role and an 'Authenticated User' group that includes all (authenticated) users. This Authenticated user group is assigned to every public project with the 'Associated' role but as the number of workflow permutations is a function trackers X roles, a new role requires configuring (and maintaining) an additional workflow for each tracker.\r\n\r\nThis work around gives us the results we need but it also requires an additional step to ensure each user gets put into the 'Authenticated user' group.\r\n\r\nWhile this work around is more or less acceptable, it would be friendlier if the issue Assignee selection list on the New Issue view and the add watcher list on the update issue view could be sorted and grouped by roles. Or better yet, sorted by roles and have the roles expandable/collapsable! Also, the issue Watcher list on the New Issue view would also be more friendly if it also were a select list as on the update issue view or at least expandable/collapsable as described above.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"}]}}

Tracker A that are assigned to Paul and Tracker B that are assigned to John. You need to see both of these side-by-side to be able to compare the due dates between the two and take action as needed.\r\nYou define your first \"query\"/filter by filtering for Tracker: \"A\" and Assigned to: \"Paul\". After that, you click a \"+\" icon below the filter/options that adds another set of filter/options and you can define your second \"query\"/filter by setting Tracker: \"B\" and Assigned to: \"John\". Click apply and it will run both queries, distinct & union the result set and display accordingly. The displayed columns would be shared between all issues.\r\n\r\nThis could also lead into some sort of combined custom query searching capability if that is something you guys want to explore.\r\n\r\n----"}]}}

Tracker A that are assigned to Paul and Tracker B that are assigned to John. You need to see both of these side-by-side to be able to compare the due dates between the two and take action as needed.\r\nYou define your first \"query\"/filter by filtering for Tracker: \"A\" and Assigned to: \"Paul\". After that, you click a \"+\" icon below the filter/options that adds another set of filter/options and you can define your second \"query\"/filter by setting Tracker: \"B\" and Assigned to: \"John\". Click apply and it will run both queries, distinct & union the result set and display accordingly. The displayed columns would be shared between all issues.\r\n\r\nThis could also lead into some sort of combined custom query searching capability if that is something you guys want to explore.\r\n\r\n----"}]}}

This Authenticated user group is assigned to every public project with the 'Associated' role but as the number of workflow permutations is a function trackers X roles, a new role requires configuring (and maintaining) an additional workflow for each tracker.\r\n\r\nThis work around gives us the results we need but it also requires an additional step to ensure each user gets put into the 'Authenticated user' group.\r\n\r\nWhile this work around is more or less acceptable, it would be friendlier if the issue Assignee selection list on the New Issue view and the add watcher list on the update issue view could be sorted and grouped by roles. Or better yet, sorted by roles and have the roles expandable/collapsable! Also, the issue Watcher list on the New Issue view would also be more friendly if it also were a select list as on the update issue view or at least expandable/collapsable as described above.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"}]}}

Specifically, we are sending one mail per recipient user. Each of those mails is rendered in the context of the recipient (i.e. with @User.current@ set to the recipient). The mails can be sent immediately or optionally delayed using ActiveJob.\r\n\r\nThis approach has a couple of advantages over the existing approach of sending a single mail to multiple recipients:\r\n\r\n* We ensure object visibility for the rendered mails in the most generic way. Since each mail is rendered with @User.current@ set to the recipient, all content rendered in the mail (including shown issue attributes, macros and links in rendered textile text, ...) is guaranteed to only be visible to the user without having to ensure this manually for each mail using the same visibility rules as used for the HTML views already.\r\n* The mail will always be sent in the recipients language, even if multiple users with different languages are notified\r\n* There is no risk of the whole notification mail being rejected because of a single invalid recipient address (see #8157, #6829, #8733 and a lot of duplicates)\r\n\r\nIn the long run, it will also allow us to introduce user-specific additional information in the rendered notification, e.g. related issues, links to assign the issue, ...\r\n\r\nWith this new approach, we do have a some challenges which we are trying to address separately:\r\n\r\n* Since each mail is always rendered with an adapted @User.current@, any mail views which expected to use the original @User.current@ need to be adapted. In Redmine core, this only affects the security notifications.\r\n* Depending on the number of recipients for a notification, there might be many rendered mails which can take some time in the request. To ensure a snappy response, we can use ActiveJob to render and send the mails in the background. This can make the @async_*@ delivery methods obsolete.\r\n\r\nh2. Reminder: How mail sending works in plain Rails (and Redmine)\r\n\r\nThis patch series changes how mails are generated and delivered. Let's first look at how a mail normally gets generated and delivered in ActionMailer.\r\n\r\n* @mail = Mailer.news_added(news)@ - The user calls a class-method of the Mailer class (a child-class of ActionMailer::Base). This method is usually not implemented in the @Mailer@ class itself. Instead, there is a \"@method_missing@\":https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v5.1.2/actionmailer/lib/action_mailer/base.rb#L576-L582 method on @ActionMailer::Base@. Here, ActionMailer creates a @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object. Which is basically a delegator to an _eventually rendered_ mail object. Now, the mail is not actually rendered here. The @MessageDelivery@ object only collects all arguments it needs to eventually render the mail. This happens implicitly when any method on the mail is accessed (e.g. when the mail is about to be delivered). The @MessageDelivery@ delegator is returned to the user.\r\n\r\nNow that we have the (delegated) mail, we can deliver it with @mail.deliver@. This method used to be the only delivery method. With newer Rails versions, there is (with some variations) @deliver_now@ and @deliver_later@. Redmine usually calls @deliver@ which in source:trunk/config/initializers/10-patches.rb#L160 calls @deliver_now@ currently.\r\n\r\nWhen calling @mail.deliver@, the delegator starts to render the mail:\r\n\r\n* \"@MessageDelivery#processed_mailer@\":https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v5.1.3/actionmailer/lib/action_mailer/message_delivery.rb#L103-L107 creates a new @Mailer@ instance and calls @process@ on it.\r\n* @Mailer#process(:news_added, news)@ - The @process@ method is part of ActionMailer (and in turn part of the @ActionController@ framework on which ActionMailer is based on). Among things, it calls the specified action, i.e. the instance method.\r\n* @Mailer#news_added(news)@ - This instance method is implemented on the Mailer class and is responsible to render the actual mail message. Here, we set headers, instance variables for the view and basically do the usual controller stuff. With a final call to @mail@, we eventually render a single mail and return a @Mail::Message@ object.\r\n* This returned @Mail::Message@ object is delivered with a call to @Mail::Message#deliver_now@.\r\n\r\nh2. How we hook into this process\r\n\r\nNow, in order to send multiple mails, we hook into this process to render (and deliver) multiple mails. We want to ensure two things:\r\n\r\n* We want to create multiple mails, one per recipient and deliver them all in one go.\r\n* When rendering the mail (i.e. when calling the Mailer's instance method), we want to set @User.current@ to the recipient user and set it back to the original value after the rendering is done\r\n\r\nThese two goals are achieved with two specific changes to our Mailer:\r\n\r\nWe introduce a wrapper class called @Mailer::MultiMessage@. Instances of this class wrap multiple @Mail::Message@ objects (or rather @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ objects which delegate to @Mail::Message@ objects). The class provides the same @deliver_*@ methods as the original @Mail::Message@ objects. When calling such a method, we are calling it on each of the wrapped messages. This allows us to use an instance of this class in place of a @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object.\r\n\r\nWe use this class by implementing _class methods_ for each mailer action. These class methods implement the same external interface (i.e. accept the same arguments) as the old instance methods. This ensures that we keep the existing public interface. The class methods fetch the recipient users for the respective object (i.e. the issue, news, comment, ...). We use @Mailer::MultiMessage#for@ to add an @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object for each recipient which eventually renders the mail.\r\n\r\nWhen creating the delegator, we also pass the recipient user to the arguments for the mail rendering. We use this user in the overwritten @Mailer#process@ method to set @User.current@ and their language before actually rendering the message. This convention allows us to keep the interfaces clear: the user is only passed between the class method and @Mailer#process@ but doesn't need to be specified on the instance action. Here, it is already set as @User.current@ for each rendered mail.\r\n\r\nWe also extend @Mailer.method_missing@ (on the class) to create a single-mail @Mailer::MultiMessage@ object with the current user in case the class method for an action is not explicitly overwritten. This ensures that our convention of always passing a user to @Mailer#process@ is kept up even if a plugin only adds an instance method (which was valid before).\r\n\r\nh2. What we tried and did not work\r\n\r\nI first attempted to set the current user directly in the action's class method. and reset it directly afterwards. That would have made the code much more localized. However, due to the delayed rendering of the mail with the @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object, the mail will be rendered only after we have already reset the current user.\r\n\r\nOne way to work around this would be to introduce @deliver_*@ methods (like the now obsolete @Mailer.deliver_issue_add@ method). However doing so would have changed the intended external interface of our @Mailer@ class and would likely lead to integration pain with all existing Redmine plugins sending mail.\r\n\r\nh2. What we ship\r\n\r\nWe ship three patches here:\r\n\r\n* @0001-Send-individual-emails-for-each-mail-recipient.patch@ - The main implementation including tests.\r\n* @0002-Cleanup-Remove-Issue-each_notification-and-Journal-e.patch@ - Removes unneccessary methods for grouping recipients based on custom field visibility\r\n* @0003-Optional-Ensure-that-ActiveRecord-Base-objects-are-f.patch@ - An optional patch which changes the serialization behavior when sending mails with ActiveJob (e.g. with @Mailer.news_added(news).deliver_later@). By default, Rails serialized the arguments as a globalid (which is basically a reference to the object in the database identified by its ID). If there are concurrent changes to e.g. a newly created issue, this might result in notifications using the new state instead of the original state. With this patch, we serialize the exact attributes of the given objects into the job. Since this also causes nested attributes to be serialized along, care must be taken to avoid reference errors. In general, we should probably try to use mostly immutable state in the database where it is an important consideration that the notification state is exactly shown in the DB.\r\n\r\nh2. Future work\r\n\r\nh3. ActiveJob sending\r\n\r\nIf the general direction of this patch is accepted, it is probably desireable to move the mail sending to ActiveJob completely. This could replace the @async_*@ delivery methods [[EmailConfiguration#Asynchronous-delivery_methods|currently configurable]] in @configuration.yml@. This change can either be hardcoded in source:trunk/config/initializers/10-patches.rb#L160 or made configurable with a setting. I'll be glad to provide a patch for this. It would only be a few lines of code.\r\n\r\nBy default, we could use the in-process ActiveJob runner to send mails. More advanced users with a dedicated job worker (e.g. delayed job) can easily switch to that without changes to the Redmine code itself.\r\n\r\nh3. BCC recipients\r\n\r\nSince each user gets their own mail, we can probably remove the setting to send mails with BCC completely. If plugins want to send mails to non-user recipients, we would have to make sure to either set the recipients manually on BCC or group them appropriately. It is not a required setting in Redmine core anymore though."}]}}

Otherwise the relation will be ignored.\r\n\r\nTo work around this limitation, the issue import could be extended to use multiple passes:\r\n\r\n# one to import basic issue properties\r\n# one to import relations to other issues\r\n\r\nThis way it becomes easier to create the CSV files for imports, since order is no longer important.\r\n\r\nThis change would also be a prerequisite to import general issue relations. Since those cannot be more complex that parent relations and cannot necessarily be linearized properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAttached you find a patch series based on trunk r15361.\r\n\r\nWhile implemented the changes, I tried to keep the @Import@ free from issue related information. Other existing @Import@ sub classes - within plugins e.g. - should need as little updates as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. 0001 Extend test data for issue import\r\n\r\nThis change adds two rows to the existing issue import fixture file. These rows contain a parent and a child issue, while the parent is placed after the child. This would not import properly given the current implementation.\r\n\r\nThe patch also updates the existing tests, where the number of imported issues is asserted.\r\n\r\nh3. 0002 Add test for issue relations to following rows\r\n\r\nThis patch extends the existing parent issue import test to also verify that the newly introduced parent child relation is properly imported. This test fails with the current implementation.\r\n\r\nh3. 0003 Multi-pass CSV import\r\n\r\nThis patch defines a @required_passes@ method within @Import@ which returns @1@ by default and may be overwritten in sub classes. The @IssueImport@ does so and returns @1@ if no @parent_id@ mapping was set, otherwise it returns @2@.\r\n\r\nThe @run@ method is split into @run@ and @run_pass@. The first one is recursive and called once for each pass. It also handles the @max_*@ options. The second is only responsible for reading the rows, creating or updating the ImportItems and passing everything to @build_object@.\r\n\r\nSince @build_object@ may now be called multiple times (once for each pass), the argument list was extended to provide more context. If somebody created a custom import in a plugin, this would need to be changed by the plugin's author.\r\n\r\nIn the @IssueImport@, @build_object@ is now split into @build_issue@ and @build_relations@, the first is called in the first pass, the second in pass 2.\r\n\r\nThe patch also contains a migration, which adds a @completed_passes@ field to @ImportItem@. This is needed to properly (re-)store progress for multi-step imports, like the ones via the web UI.\r\n\r\nFinally the patch adds some test to make sure, that the general behavior of multi-step imports did not change with the introduction of multi-pass imports.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Disclaimer*: I know, this is a rather large change to fix a minor nuisance. But as mentioned earlier, I think, this change is a necessary prerequisite to support importing \"Related Issues\" properly, which I would like to contribute next, if this patch is accepted."}]}}

With these 2 new filters you can cover most of the use cases related to target version. \r\nSome examples:\r\n- a query that returns all the issues that are assigned in open versions\r\n- a query that returns all the issues that are assigned in versions with due date\r\n\r\nThe attached patch:\r\n- implements these new 2 filters\r\n- groups the target version status and target version due date with target version's custom fields under the label Target Version . I wasn't sure that is a good idea to move also the existing target version filter (name) to this group. (attached target_version_group.png)\r\n- adds 2 new tests\r\n- breaks an existing tests (QueryTest#test_total_by_project_group_for_spent_hours), but  I'm not sure how to fix the problem. The respective test have also a to do comment to remove some code after this \"issue\":https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/21922 is fixed (and is was fixed). \r\n\r\nI think that this ticket is related to #21249  \r\n"}]}}

With these 2 new filters you can cover most of the use cases related to target version. \r\nSome examples:\r\n- a query that returns all the issues that are assigned in open versions\r\n- a query that returns all the issues that are assigned in versions with due date\r\n\r\nThe attached patch:\r\n- implements these new 2 filters\r\n- groups the target version status and target version due date with target version's custom fields under the label Target Version . I wasn't sure that is a good idea to move also the existing target version filter (name) to this group. (attached target_version_group.png)\r\n- adds 2 new tests\r\n- breaks an existing tests (QueryTest#test_total_by_project_group_for_spent_hours), but  I'm not sure how to fix the problem.

Tracker A that are assigned to Paul and Tracker B that are assigned to John. You need to see both of these side-by-side to be able to compare the due dates between the two and take action as needed.\r\nYou define your first \"query\"/filter by filtering for Tracker: \"A\" and Assigned to: \"Paul\". After that, you click a \"+\" icon below the filter/options that adds another set of filter/options and you can define your second \"query\"/filter by setting Tracker: \"B\" and Assigned to: \"John\". Click apply and it will run both queries, distinct & union the result set and display accordingly. The displayed columns would be shared between all issues.\r\n\r\nThis could also lead into some sort of combined custom query searching capability if that is something you guys want to explore.\r\n\r\n----"}]}}

Otherwise the relation will be ignored.\r\n\r\nTo work around this limitation, the issue import could be extended to use multiple passes:\r\n\r\n# one to import basic issue properties\r\n# one to import relations to other issues\r\n\r\nThis way it becomes easier to create the CSV files for imports, since order is no longer important.\r\n\r\nThis change would also be a prerequisite to import general issue relations. Since those cannot be more complex that parent relations and cannot necessarily be linearized properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAttached you find a patch series based on trunk r15361.\r\n\r\nWhile implemented the changes, I tried to keep the @Import@ free from issue related information. Other existing @Import@ sub classes - within plugins e.g. - should need as little updates as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. 0001 Extend test data for issue import\r\n\r\nThis change adds two rows to the existing issue import fixture file. These rows contain a parent and a child issue, while the parent is placed after the child. This would not import properly given the current implementation.\r\n\r\nThe patch also updates the existing tests, where the number of imported issues is asserted.\r\n\r\nh3. 0002 Add test for issue relations to following rows\r\n\r\nThis patch extends the existing parent issue import test to also verify that the newly introduced parent child relation is properly imported. This test fails with the current implementation.\r\n\r\nh3. 0003 Multi-pass CSV import\r\n\r\nThis patch defines a @required_passes@ method within @Import@ which returns @1@ by default and may be overwritten in sub classes. The @IssueImport@ does so and returns @1@ if no @parent_id@ mapping was set, otherwise it returns @2@.\r\n\r\nThe @run@ method is split into @run@ and @run_pass@. The first one is recursive and called once for each pass. It also handles the @max_*@ options. The second is only responsible for reading the rows, creating or updating the ImportItems and passing everything to @build_object@.\r\n\r\nSince @build_object@ may now be called multiple times (once for each pass), the argument list was extended to provide more context. If somebody created a custom import in a plugin, this would need to be changed by the plugin's author.\r\n\r\nIn the @IssueImport@, @build_object@ is now split into @build_issue@ and @build_relations@, the first is called in the first pass, the second in pass 2.\r\n\r\nThe patch also contains a migration, which adds a @completed_passes@ field to @ImportItem@. This is needed to properly (re-)store progress for multi-step imports, like the ones via the web UI.\r\n\r\nFinally the patch adds some test to make sure, that the general behavior of multi-step imports did not change with the introduction of multi-pass imports.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Disclaimer*: I know, this is a rather large change to fix a minor nuisance. But as mentioned earlier, I think, this change is a necessary prerequisite to support importing \"Related Issues\" properly, which I would like to contribute next, if this patch is accepted."}]}}

We\u00b4d like to connect the issues directly with the import. But we cannot insert the explicit issue number, because the parent issues don\u00b4t exist before import. And the second reason is that we want to us the import file as template, so there cannot be specific numbers.\r\n\r\nUseful would be a kind of dynamic link between the issues.

Otherwise the relation will be ignored.\r\n\r\nTo work around this limitation, the issue import could be extended to use multiple passes:\r\n\r\n# one to import basic issue properties\r\n# one to import relations to other issues\r\n\r\nThis way it becomes easier to create the CSV files for imports, since order is no longer important.\r\n\r\nThis change would also be a prerequisite to import general issue relations. Since those cannot be more complex that parent relations and cannot necessarily be linearized properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAttached you find a patch series based on trunk r15361.\r\n\r\nWhile implemented the changes, I tried to keep the @Import@ free from issue related information. Other existing @Import@ sub classes - within plugins e.g. - should need as little updates as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. 0001 Extend test data for issue import\r\n\r\nThis change adds two rows to the existing issue import fixture file. These rows contain a parent and a child issue, while the parent is placed after the child. This would not import properly given the current implementation.\r\n\r\nThe patch also updates the existing tests, where the number of imported issues is asserted.\r\n\r\nh3. 0002 Add test for issue relations to following rows\r\n\r\nThis patch extends the existing parent issue import test to also verify that the newly introduced parent child relation is properly imported. This test fails with the current implementation.\r\n\r\nh3. 0003 Multi-pass CSV import\r\n\r\nThis patch defines a @required_passes@ method within @Import@ which returns @1@ by default and may be overwritten in sub classes. The @IssueImport@ does so and returns @1@ if no @parent_id@ mapping was set, otherwise it returns @2@.\r\n\r\nThe @run@ method is split into @run@ and @run_pass@. The first one is recursive and called once for each pass. It also handles the @max_*@ options. The second is only responsible for reading the rows, creating or updating the ImportItems and passing everything to @build_object@.\r\n\r\nSince @build_object@ may now be called multiple times (once for each pass), the argument list was extended to provide more context. If somebody created a custom import in a plugin, this would need to be changed by the plugin's author.\r\n\r\nIn the @IssueImport@, @build_object@ is now split into @build_issue@ and @build_relations@, the first is called in the first pass, the second in pass 2.\r\n\r\nThe patch also contains a migration, which adds a @completed_passes@ field to @ImportItem@. This is needed to properly (re-)store progress for multi-step imports, like the ones via the web UI.\r\n\r\nFinally the patch adds some test to make sure, that the general behavior of multi-step imports did not change with the introduction of multi-pass imports.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Disclaimer*: I know, this is a rather large change to fix a minor nuisance. But as mentioned earlier, I think, this change is a necessary prerequisite to support importing \"Related Issues\" properly, which I would like to contribute next, if this patch is accepted."}]}}

Usage\r\n\r\nThe attached patch extends the import configuration view with a new block, so that users may select a column for each relation type. The parent issue field also moved to the new block, since it's conceptually related.\r\n\r\nWithin the CSV file the columns may define multiple relations of the same type, each separated with @,@. Related issues follow the same rules as parent issues. A string preceded with a @#@ is supposed to be an existing issue. Without the @#@ it's supposed to be another row within the import file. For _follows_ and _precedes_ relations an additional delay may be present, e.g. @#12 3d@ specifying a relation to issue @#12@ and a delay of 3 days.\r\n\r\nh3. Technical notes\r\n\r\nSince issue relations may only be created when the issue was already saved, I've added a second step to the import. Additionally to @build_object@, which needs to be implemented by @Import@ sub classes, there's also a @extend_object@ method now. This is used by the @IssueImporter@ to save the relations after the issue was already saved successfully.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Additional considerations\r\n\r\nInitially, I wanted to build the import, so that issue relations exported from Redmine could be imported directly. But the format that's used by the exporter was designed for humans, not so much for computers. Most importantly, to parse this format we would need to grep for the localized relation names, which might even change between versions of Redmine. Therefore I settled for the proposed approach of having separate columns for each relation type."}]}}

This Authenticated user group is assigned to every public project with the 'Associated' role but as the number of workflow permutations is a function trackers X roles, a new role requires configuring (and maintaining) an additional workflow for each tracker.\r\n\r\nThis work around gives us the results we need but it also requires an additional step to ensure each user gets put into the 'Authenticated user' group.\r\n\r\nWhile this work around is more or less acceptable, it would be friendlier if the issue Assignee selection list on the New Issue view and the add watcher list on the update issue view could be sorted and grouped by roles. Or better yet, sorted by roles and have the roles expandable/collapsable!

Tracker A that are assigned to Paul and Tracker B that are assigned to John. You need to see both of these side-by-side to be able to compare the due dates between the two and take action as needed.\r\nYou define your first \"query\"/filter by filtering for Tracker: \"A\" and Assigned to: \"Paul\". After that, you click a \"+\" icon below the filter/options that adds another set of filter/options and you can define your second \"query\"/filter by setting Tracker: \"B\" and Assigned to: \"John\". Click apply and it will run both queries, distinct & union the result set and display accordingly. The displayed columns would be shared between all issues.\r\n\r\nThis could also lead into some sort of combined custom query searching capability if that is something you guys want to explore.\r\n\r\n----"}]}}

Adding the time entry import\r\n\r\nThe second patch attached adds the time entry import. It's using the newly introduced extension points to fill in the blanks. To provide a way for the user to find the new import, I've added the @timelog/_sidebar@ partial, similar to the one for issues. This new sidebar partial is now used in the timelog views and it contains a link to the import.\r\n\r\n*Note:* within said partial, I've mis/re-used an i18n key @label_time_entries_visibility_all@ since it was providing the desired text in German and English. I did not want to introduce a new key based on the existing one, since that would have probably caused major merge problems. If desired, I may of course do that anyway.\r\n\r\nh3. Closing notes\r\n\r\nThe second patch may of course also become a plugin. The main point of this patch (series) was it, to allow plugins to reuse the existing plugin infrastructure. Without the first patch though, a plugin author would need copy most of the views and functionality of the imports class, which is undesirable (at least for the plugin author).\r\n\r\nThank you for considering these patches.\n\n-- Ticket2\n--Subject--\nAllow forward reference to parent when importing issues\n\n--Description--\nWhen importing issues via CSV with parent relations, the parent issues need to be positioned before child issues. Otherwise the relation will be ignored.\r\n\r\nTo work around this limitation, the issue import could be extended to use multiple passes:\r\n\r\n# one to import basic issue properties\r\n# one to import relations to other issues\r\n\r\nThis way it becomes easier to create the CSV files for imports, since order is no longer important.\r\n\r\nThis change would also be a prerequisite to import general issue relations. Since those cannot be more complex that parent relations and cannot necessarily be linearized properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAttached you find a patch series based on trunk r15361.\r\n\r\nWhile implemented the changes, I tried to keep the @Import@ free from issue related information. Other existing @Import@ sub classes - within plugins e.g. - should need as little updates as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. 0001 Extend test data for issue import\r\n\r\nThis change adds two rows to the existing issue import fixture file. These rows contain a parent and a child issue, while the parent is placed after the child. This would not import properly given the current implementation.\r\n\r\nThe patch also updates the existing tests, where the number of imported issues is asserted.\r\n\r\nh3. 0002 Add test for issue relations to following rows\r\n\r\nThis patch extends the existing parent issue import test to also verify that the newly introduced parent child relation is properly imported. This test fails with the current implementation.\r\n\r\nh3. 0003 Multi-pass CSV import\r\n\r\nThis patch defines a @required_passes@ method within @Import@ which returns @1@ by default and may be overwritten in sub classes. The @IssueImport@ does so and returns @1@ if no @parent_id@ mapping was set, otherwise it returns @2@.\r\n\r\nThe @run@ method is split into @run@ and @run_pass@. The first one is recursive and called once for each pass. It also handles the @max_*@ options. The second is only responsible for reading the rows, creating or updating the ImportItems and passing everything to @build_object@.\r\n\r\nSince @build_object@ may now be called multiple times (once for each pass), the argument list was extended to provide more context. If somebody created a custom import in a plugin, this would need to be changed by the plugin's author.\r\n\r\nIn the @IssueImport@, @build_object@ is now split into @build_issue@ and @build_relations@, the first is called in the first pass, the second in pass 2.\r\n\r\nThe patch also contains a migration, which adds a @completed_passes@ field to @ImportItem@. This is needed to properly (re-)store progress for multi-step imports, like the ones via the web UI.\r\n\r\nFinally the patch adds some test to make sure, that the general behavior of multi-step imports did not change with the introduction of multi-pass imports.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Disclaimer*: I know, this is a rather large change to fix a minor nuisance. But as mentioned earlier, I think, this change is a necessary prerequisite to support importing \"Related Issues\" properly, which I would like to contribute next, if this patch is accepted."}]}}

Usage\r\n\r\nThe attached patch extends the import configuration view with a new block, so that users may select a column for each relation type. The parent issue field also moved to the new block, since it's conceptually related.\r\n\r\nWithin the CSV file the columns may define multiple relations of the same type, each separated with @,@. Related issues follow the same rules as parent issues. A string preceded with a @#@ is supposed to be an existing issue. Without the @#@ it's supposed to be another row within the import file. For _follows_ and _precedes_ relations an additional delay may be present, e.g. @#12 3d@ specifying a relation to issue @#12@ and a delay of 3 days.\r\n\r\nh3. Technical notes\r\n\r\nSince issue relations may only be created when the issue was already saved, I've added a second step to the import. Additionally to @build_object@, which needs to be implemented by @Import@ sub classes, there's also a @extend_object@ method now. This is used by the @IssueImporter@ to save the relations after the issue was already saved successfully.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Additional considerations\r\n\r\nInitially, I wanted to build the import, so that issue relations exported from Redmine could be imported directly. But the format that's used by the exporter was designed for humans, not so much for computers. Most importantly, to parse this format we would need to grep for the localized relation names, which might even change between versions of Redmine. Therefore I settled for the proposed approach of having separate columns for each relation type."}]}}

This Authenticated user group is assigned to every public project with the 'Associated' role but as the number of workflow permutations is a function trackers X roles, a new role requires configuring (and maintaining) an additional workflow for each tracker.\r\n\r\nThis work around gives us the results we need but it also requires an additional step to ensure each user gets put into the 'Authenticated user' group.\r\n\r\nWhile this work around is more or less acceptable, it would be friendlier if the issue Assignee selection list on the New Issue view and the add watcher list on the update issue view could be sorted and grouped by roles. Or better yet, sorted by roles and have the roles expandable/collapsable! Also, the issue Watcher list on the New Issue view would also be more friendly if it also were a select list as on the update issue view or at least expandable/collapsable as described above.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"}]}}

This Authenticated user group is assigned to every public project with the 'Associated' role but as the number of workflow permutations is a function trackers X roles, a new role requires configuring (and maintaining) an additional workflow for each tracker.\r\n\r\nThis work around gives us the results we need but it also requires an additional step to ensure each user gets put into the 'Authenticated user' group.\r\n\r\nWhile this work around is more or less acceptable, it would be friendlier if the issue Assignee selection list on the New Issue view and the add watcher list on the update issue view could be sorted and grouped by roles. Or better yet, sorted by roles and have the roles expandable/collapsable! Also, the issue Watcher list on the New Issue view would also be more friendly if it also were a select list as on the update issue view or at least expandable/collapsable as described above.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"}]}}

The misoperation is probably caused by the current UI of Redmine. The delete button at the bottom of IssuesController#show page looks as if it is a button for delete the last note, but actually it is a button to deletes the issue.\r\n\r\nSuch misoperation can be prevented by making a slight change to UI. Please see the following screenshots. By adding border around issue history, it becomes clear that the button is not a button for deleting the note. Our company have succeeded in significantly reducing accidents that our customers mistakenly delete an issue by implementing the change.\r\n\r\nThe patch was extracted from \"farend basic\":https://github.com/farend/redmine_theme_farend_basic theme.\r\n\r\n*Before:*\r\n!{width: 787px;border: 1px solid #ccc;}.border-around-history-before@2x.png!\r\n\r\n*After:*\r\n!{width: 787px;border: 1px solid #ccc;}.border-around-history-after@2x.png!\r\n"}]}}

Usage\r\n\r\nThe attached patch extends the import configuration view with a new block, so that users may select a column for each relation type. The parent issue field also moved to the new block, since it's conceptually related.\r\n\r\nWithin the CSV file the columns may define multiple relations of the same type, each separated with @,@. Related issues follow the same rules as parent issues. A string preceded with a @#@ is supposed to be an existing issue. Without the @#@ it's supposed to be another row within the import file. For _follows_ and _precedes_ relations an additional delay may be present, e.g. @#12 3d@ specifying a relation to issue @#12@ and a delay of 3 days.\r\n\r\nh3. Technical notes\r\n\r\nSince issue relations may only be created when the issue was already saved, I've added a second step to the import. Additionally to @build_object@, which needs to be implemented by @Import@ sub classes, there's also a @extend_object@ method now. This is used by the @IssueImporter@ to save the relations after the issue was already saved successfully.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Additional considerations\r\n\r\nInitially, I wanted to build the import, so that issue relations exported from Redmine could be imported directly. But the format that's used by the exporter was designed for humans, not so much for computers. Most importantly, to parse this format we would need to grep for the localized relation names, which might even change between versions of Redmine. Therefore I settled for the proposed approach of having separate columns for each relation type."}]}}

This Authenticated user group is assigned to every public project with the 'Associated' role but as the number of workflow permutations is a function trackers X roles, a new role requires configuring (and maintaining) an additional workflow for each tracker.\r\n\r\nThis work around gives us the results we need but it also requires an additional step to ensure each user gets put into the 'Authenticated user' group.\r\n\r\nWhile this work around is more or less acceptable, it would be friendlier if the issue Assignee selection list on the New Issue view and the add watcher list on the update issue view could be sorted and grouped by roles. Or better yet, sorted by roles and have the roles expandable/collapsable! Also, the issue Watcher list on the New Issue view would also be more friendly if it also were a select list as on the update issue view or at least expandable/collapsable as described above.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"}]}}

Specifically, we are sending one mail per recipient user. Each of those mails is rendered in the context of the recipient (i.e. with @User.current@ set to the recipient). The mails can be sent immediately or optionally delayed using ActiveJob.\r\n\r\nThis approach has a couple of advantages over the existing approach of sending a single mail to multiple recipients:\r\n\r\n* We ensure object visibility for the rendered mails in the most generic way. Since each mail is rendered with @User.current@ set to the recipient, all content rendered in the mail (including shown issue attributes, macros and links in rendered textile text, ...) is guaranteed to only be visible to the user without having to ensure this manually for each mail using the same visibility rules as used for the HTML views already.\r\n* The mail will always be sent in the recipients language, even if multiple users with different languages are notified\r\n* There is no risk of the whole notification mail being rejected because of a single invalid recipient address (see #8157, #6829, #8733 and a lot of duplicates)\r\n\r\nIn the long run, it will also allow us to introduce user-specific additional information in the rendered notification, e.g. related issues, links to assign the issue, ...\r\n\r\nWith this new approach, we do have a some challenges which we are trying to address separately:\r\n\r\n* Since each mail is always rendered with an adapted @User.current@, any mail views which expected to use the original @User.current@ need to be adapted. In Redmine core, this only affects the security notifications.\r\n* Depending on the number of recipients for a notification, there might be many rendered mails which can take some time in the request. To ensure a snappy response, we can use ActiveJob to render and send the mails in the background. This can make the @async_*@ delivery methods obsolete.\r\n\r\nh2. Reminder: How mail sending works in plain Rails (and Redmine)\r\n\r\nThis patch series changes how mails are generated and delivered. Let's first look at how a mail normally gets generated and delivered in ActionMailer.\r\n\r\n* @mail = Mailer.news_added(news)@ - The user calls a class-method of the Mailer class (a child-class of ActionMailer::Base). This method is usually not implemented in the @Mailer@ class itself. Instead, there is a \"@method_missing@\":https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v5.1.2/actionmailer/lib/action_mailer/base.rb#L576-L582 method on @ActionMailer::Base@. Here, ActionMailer creates a @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object. Which is basically a delegator to an _eventually rendered_ mail object. Now, the mail is not actually rendered here. The @MessageDelivery@ object only collects all arguments it needs to eventually render the mail. This happens implicitly when any method on the mail is accessed (e.g. when the mail is about to be delivered). The @MessageDelivery@ delegator is returned to the user.\r\n\r\nNow that we have the (delegated) mail, we can deliver it with @mail.deliver@. This method used to be the only delivery method. With newer Rails versions, there is (with some variations) @deliver_now@ and @deliver_later@. Redmine usually calls @deliver@ which in source:trunk/config/initializers/10-patches.rb#L160 calls @deliver_now@ currently.\r\n\r\nWhen calling @mail.deliver@, the delegator starts to render the mail:\r\n\r\n* \"@MessageDelivery#processed_mailer@\":https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v5.1.3/actionmailer/lib/action_mailer/message_delivery.rb#L103-L107 creates a new @Mailer@ instance and calls @process@ on it.\r\n* @Mailer#process(:news_added, news)@ - The @process@ method is part of ActionMailer (and in turn part of the @ActionController@ framework on which ActionMailer is based on). Among things, it calls the specified action, i.e. the instance method.\r\n* @Mailer#news_added(news)@ - This instance method is implemented on the Mailer class and is responsible to render the actual mail message. Here, we set headers, instance variables for the view and basically do the usual controller stuff. With a final call to @mail@, we eventually render a single mail and return a @Mail::Message@ object.\r\n* This returned @Mail::Message@ object is delivered with a call to @Mail::Message#deliver_now@.\r\n\r\nh2. How we hook into this process\r\n\r\nNow, in order to send multiple mails, we hook into this process to render (and deliver) multiple mails. We want to ensure two things:\r\n\r\n* We want to create multiple mails, one per recipient and deliver them all in one go.\r\n* When rendering the mail (i.e. when calling the Mailer's instance method), we want to set @User.current@ to the recipient user and set it back to the original value after the rendering is done\r\n\r\nThese two goals are achieved with two specific changes to our Mailer:\r\n\r\nWe introduce a wrapper class called @Mailer::MultiMessage@. Instances of this class wrap multiple @Mail::Message@ objects (or rather @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ objects which delegate to @Mail::Message@ objects). The class provides the same @deliver_*@ methods as the original @Mail::Message@ objects. When calling such a method, we are calling it on each of the wrapped messages. This allows us to use an instance of this class in place of a @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object.\r\n\r\nWe use this class by implementing _class methods_ for each mailer action. These class methods implement the same external interface (i.e. accept the same arguments) as the old instance methods. This ensures that we keep the existing public interface. The class methods fetch the recipient users for the respective object (i.e. the issue, news, comment, ...). We use @Mailer::MultiMessage#for@ to add an @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object for each recipient which eventually renders the mail.\r\n\r\nWhen creating the delegator, we also pass the recipient user to the arguments for the mail rendering. We use this user in the overwritten @Mailer#process@ method to set @User.current@ and their language before actually rendering the message. This convention allows us to keep the interfaces clear: the user is only passed between the class method and @Mailer#process@ but doesn't need to be specified on the instance action. Here, it is already set as @User.current@ for each rendered mail.\r\n\r\nWe also extend @Mailer.method_missing@ (on the class) to create a single-mail @Mailer::MultiMessage@ object with the current user in case the class method for an action is not explicitly overwritten. This ensures that our convention of always passing a user to @Mailer#process@ is kept up even if a plugin only adds an instance method (which was valid before).\r\n\r\nh2. What we tried and did not work\r\n\r\nI first attempted to set the current user directly in the action's class method. and reset it directly afterwards. That would have made the code much more localized. However, due to the delayed rendering of the mail with the @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object, the mail will be rendered only after we have already reset the current user.\r\n\r\nOne way to work around this would be to introduce @deliver_*@ methods (like the now obsolete @Mailer.deliver_issue_add@ method). However doing so would have changed the intended external interface of our @Mailer@ class and would likely lead to integration pain with all existing Redmine plugins sending mail.\r\n\r\nh2. What we ship\r\n\r\nWe ship three patches here:\r\n\r\n* @0001-Send-individual-emails-for-each-mail-recipient.patch@ - The main implementation including tests.\r\n* @0002-Cleanup-Remove-Issue-each_notification-and-Journal-e.patch@ - Removes unneccessary methods for grouping recipients based on custom field visibility\r\n* @0003-Optional-Ensure-that-ActiveRecord-Base-objects-are-f.patch@ - An optional patch which changes the serialization behavior when sending mails with ActiveJob (e.g. with @Mailer.news_added(news).deliver_later@). By default, Rails serialized the arguments as a globalid (which is basically a reference to the object in the database identified by its ID). If there are concurrent changes to e.g. a newly created issue, this might result in notifications using the new state instead of the original state. With this patch, we serialize the exact attributes of the given objects into the job. Since this also causes nested attributes to be serialized along, care must be taken to avoid reference errors. In general, we should probably try to use mostly immutable state in the database where it is an important consideration that the notification state is exactly shown in the DB.\r\n\r\nh2. Future work\r\n\r\nh3. ActiveJob sending\r\n\r\nIf the general direction of this patch is accepted, it is probably desireable to move the mail sending to ActiveJob completely. This could replace the @async_*@ delivery methods [[EmailConfiguration#Asynchronous-delivery_methods|currently configurable]] in @configuration.yml@. This change can either be hardcoded in source:trunk/config/initializers/10-patches.rb#L160 or made configurable with a setting. I'll be glad to provide a patch for this. It would only be a few lines of code.\r\n\r\nBy default, we could use the in-process ActiveJob runner to send mails. More advanced users with a dedicated job worker (e.g. delayed job) can easily switch to that without changes to the Redmine code itself.\r\n\r\nh3. BCC recipients\r\n\r\nSince each user gets their own mail, we can probably remove the setting to send mails with BCC completely. If plugins want to send mails to non-user recipients, we would have to make sure to either set the recipients manually on BCC or group them appropriately. It is not a required setting in Redmine core anymore though."}]}}

Usage\r\n\r\nThe attached patch extends the import configuration view with a new block, so that users may select a column for each relation type. The parent issue field also moved to the new block, since it's conceptually related.\r\n\r\nWithin the CSV file the columns may define multiple relations of the same type, each separated with @,@. Related issues follow the same rules as parent issues. A string preceded with a @#@ is supposed to be an existing issue. Without the @#@ it's supposed to be another row within the import file. For _follows_ and _precedes_ relations an additional delay may be present, e.g. @#12 3d@ specifying a relation to issue @#12@ and a delay of 3 days.\r\n\r\nh3. Technical notes\r\n\r\nSince issue relations may only be created when the issue was already saved, I've added a second step to the import. Additionally to @build_object@, which needs to be implemented by @Import@ sub classes, there's also a @extend_object@ method now. This is used by the @IssueImporter@ to save the relations after the issue was already saved successfully.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Additional considerations\r\n\r\nInitially, I wanted to build the import, so that issue relations exported from Redmine could be imported directly. But the format that's used by the exporter was designed for humans, not so much for computers. Most importantly, to parse this format we would need to grep for the localized relation names, which might even change between versions of Redmine. Therefore I settled for the proposed approach of having separate columns for each relation type."}]}}

This Authenticated user group is assigned to every public project with the 'Associated' role but as the number of workflow permutations is a function trackers X roles, a new role requires configuring (and maintaining) an additional workflow for each tracker.\r\n\r\nThis work around gives us the results we need but it also requires an additional step to ensure each user gets put into the 'Authenticated user' group.\r\n\r\nWhile this work around is more or less acceptable, it would be friendlier if the issue Assignee selection list on the New Issue view and the add watcher list on the update issue view could be sorted and grouped by roles. Or better yet, sorted by roles and have the roles expandable/collapsable! Also, the issue Watcher list on the New Issue view would also be more friendly if it also were a select list as on the update issue view or at least expandable/collapsable as described above.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"}]}}

Tracker A that are assigned to Paul and Tracker B that are assigned to John. You need to see both of these side-by-side to be able to compare the due dates between the two and take action as needed.\r\nYou define your first \"query\"/filter by filtering for Tracker: \"A\" and Assigned to: \"Paul\". After that, you click a \"+\" icon below the filter/options that adds another set of filter/options and you can define your second \"query\"/filter by setting Tracker: \"B\" and Assigned to: \"John\". Click apply and it will run both queries, distinct & union the result set and display accordingly. The displayed columns would be shared between all issues.\r\n\r\nThis could also lead into some sort of combined custom query searching capability if that is something you guys want to explore.\r\n\r\n----"}]}}
