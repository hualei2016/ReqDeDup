This is very useful, but it doesn't cover the case when you want to enable 2FA only for administrators. As a best security practice, if you cannot enforce for all users, the administrators should be top priority to secure using 2FA. \r\n\r\nMy proposal is to add a new setting to allow enforcing 2FA only for administrators:\r\n\r\n!{width:60%;}2fa_optional.png!\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\n\n-- Ticket2\n--Subject--\nPlease consider changing the way how 2FA is set up\n\n--Description--\nHey guys,\r\n\r\nI don't want to write too much, so it is not hard for you to handle this\r\nissue.\r\n\r\nRecently the ruby bug tracker has been changed to require 2FA.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem for me as I don't have a smartphone, so the change\r\nlocked me out of the bug tracker.\r\n\r\nAnyway - this is not about that; I would like to suggest a few things.\r\n\r\n(1) Right now if you click \"sign out\" you can not sign out because\r\nthe 2FA wall shows up:\r\n\r\n\"The administrator requires you to enable two-factor authentication.\"\r\n\r\nThis should be different. It should ALWAYS be possible to sign out\r\nagain. Sure I can use cookies or use another browser, but I logged\r\ninto my account of ~13 years just now. Now the 2FA wall prevents me\r\nfrom doing anything, including \"sign out\". This is not good UI.\r\n\r\nWe should be able to log out (sign out) again.\r\n\r\nAnyway this is a smaller part.\r\n\r\n(2) The bigger issue is that I don't get any information about\r\nWHY 2FA is suddenly used, and who enabled it. Yes, I get it,\r\nthe site owner did so, but perhaps the site owner was not aware\r\nthat this will effectively perma-ban some users. Not everyone\r\nhas a smartphone or can use 2FA. I already explained this\r\non rubygems.org the github issue tracker, that mandatory 2FA\r\nmeans I can no longer use rubygems, so I'd have to remove\r\nmy account at rubygems.org (whereas at github I could still\r\npublish that code, so this is weird...)\r\n\r\nPlease consider (2), because it means that the admin of a\r\nsite may accidentally retire people from ruby, without\r\neven intending to do so. To me this is a dealbreaker, \r\nbecause it means I can no longer use the official bug tracker\r\nof ruby, which then means I can no longer voice my concern\r\n(I don't use emails really ... never liked emails in ~over\r\n20 years...). That means I'd become a second class citizen\r\nto ruby, compared to other users, and since I have no intention\r\nto accept this, it would effectively mean that I would also\r\nabandon ruby in the long run.\r\n\r\nRuby is a great language, but to me mandatory 2FA is not\r\nacceptable. While this is not the fault of redmine itself,\r\nI think usability wise several things could be improved.\r\n\r\nI assume none of you guys so far thought about how this\r\ncould cause friction and strife, so hopefully the way how\r\n2FA is explained to users can change in the long run. I\r\nhad slowly collect that information since nothing\r\nwas announced anywhere! Suddenly from one day to the\r\nother I was slapped into the face with that 2FA wall,\r\nso perhaps you can understand my frustration here."}]}}

Following a download link\r\n\r\nWhen following a download link, image are sent with @content-disposition: inline@, while all other files are sent with @attachment@. Since the some browsers is able to render PDF files directly (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, IE with Adobe Reader installed) and people are probably used to it, I think that extending this exception to PDF files is a reasonable change. If native PDF rendering within the browser is not supported, then a download will be initiated by the browser anyway.\r\n\r\nh3. 2. Displaying a PDF file in repository browser\r\n\r\nWhen accessing \"View\" within the file view in the repository browsers, Redmine currently forces a download of the PDF. Instead an iframe could be rendered which displays the PDF within the Redmine UI. Browser support for this use case is similar to No. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThe patch series is based on current trunk (r15332) plus the changes of #22482. If desired, I could isolate the changes further, to make them work without #22482.\r\n\r\nh3. @0004-Don-t-force-download-of-PDFs-but-show-in-browser-pre.patch@\r\n\r\nThe change updates @AttachmentsController@ and @RepositoryController@ to send PDF files with @content-disposition: inline@. (See first use case.)\r\n\r\nh3. @0005-Show-pdf-preview-for-repository-files-and-attachment.patch@\r\n\r\nThe change adds @attachments/pdf@ and @common/_pdf@ views to render PDF files in an iframe/object construct. (See second use case.)\r\n\r\nSince we cannot easily know the PDF\u2019s dimensions, the frame size follows the following rules:\r\n\r\n* it is as wide as possible (100%)\r\n* in general it is as high as it is wide\r\n* it is never higher than 80 % of the viewport (80vh), since we want to make sure, that there is always a bit of Redmine UI visible to avoid getting \u201ctrapped\u201d within the frame\r\n\r\nUsing a nested object/iframe structure was taken from http://pdfobject.com/static.html"}]}}

We can add watchers, but of course, they do not see the issue.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, setting the issue visibility to \"All non private issues\" would allow them to see too much tickets.\r\n\r\nSo a combination would be great: general setting for visibility is \"Issues created by or assigned to the user\" but with the exceptional case, if a person is assigned as watcher.\r\nIt should be possible, that the watcher can see those issues, he has been added to.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."}]}}

In every project there is a bunch of issues, which cover typical tasks (design, deployment, accounts, testing e.g.). These tasks are connecetd between each other via parent task. We\u00b4d like to connect the issues directly with the import. But we cannot insert the explicit issue number, because the parent issues don\u00b4t exist before import. And the second reason is that we want to us the import file as template, so there cannot be specific numbers.\r\n\r\nUseful would be a kind of dynamic link between the issues. Maybe one column in the import file represents a local ID, which can be used for the dynamic parent task link."}]}}

Usage\r\n\r\nThe attached patch extends the import configuration view with a new block, so that users may select a column for each relation type. The parent issue field also moved to the new block, since it's conceptually related.\r\n\r\nWithin the CSV file the columns may define multiple relations of the same type, each separated with @,@. Related issues follow the same rules as parent issues. A string preceded with a @#@ is supposed to be an existing issue. Without the @#@ it's supposed to be another row within the import file. For _follows_ and _precedes_ relations an additional delay may be present, e.g. @#12 3d@ specifying a relation to issue @#12@ and a delay of 3 days.\r\n\r\nh3. Technical notes\r\n\r\nSince issue relations may only be created when the issue was already saved, I've added a second step to the import. Additionally to @build_object@, which needs to be implemented by @Import@ sub classes, there's also a @extend_object@ method now. This is used by the @IssueImporter@ to save the relations after the issue was already saved successfully.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Additional considerations\r\n\r\nInitially, I wanted to build the import, so that issue relations exported from Redmine could be imported directly. But the format that's used by the exporter was designed for humans, not so much for computers. Most importantly, to parse this format we would need to grep for the localized relation names, which might even change between versions of Redmine. Therefore I settled for the proposed approach of having separate columns for each relation type."}]}}

This Authenticated user group is assigned to every public project with the 'Associated' role but as the number of workflow permutations is a function trackers X roles, a new role requires configuring (and maintaining) an additional workflow for each tracker.\r\n\r\nThis work around gives us the results we need but it also requires an additional step to ensure each user gets put into the 'Authenticated user' group.\r\n\r\nWhile this work around is more or less acceptable, it would be friendlier if the issue Assignee selection list on the New Issue view and the add watcher list on the update issue view could be sorted and grouped by roles. Or better yet, sorted by roles and have the roles expandable/collapsable!

Tracker A that are assigned to Paul and Tracker B that are assigned to John. You need to see both of these side-by-side to be able to compare the due dates between the two and take action as needed.\r\nYou define your first \"query\"/filter by filtering for Tracker: \"A\" and Assigned to: \"Paul\". After that, you click a \"+\" icon below the filter/options that adds another set of filter/options and you can define your second \"query\"/filter by setting Tracker: \"B\" and Assigned to: \"John\". Click apply and it will run both queries, distinct & union the result set and display accordingly. The displayed columns would be shared between all issues.\r\n\r\nThis could also lead into some sort of combined custom query searching capability if that is something you guys want to explore.\r\n\r\n----"}]}}

Following a download link\r\n\r\nWhen following a download link, image are sent with @content-disposition: inline@, while all other files are sent with @attachment@. Since the some browsers is able to render PDF files directly (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, IE with Adobe Reader installed) and people are probably used to it, I think that extending this exception to PDF files is a reasonable change. If native PDF rendering within the browser is not supported, then a download will be initiated by the browser anyway.\r\n\r\nh3. 2. Displaying a PDF file in repository browser\r\n\r\nWhen accessing \"View\" within the file view in the repository browsers, Redmine currently forces a download of the PDF. Instead an iframe could be rendered which displays the PDF within the Redmine UI. Browser support for this use case is similar to No. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThe patch series is based on current trunk (r15332) plus the changes of #22482. If desired, I could isolate the changes further, to make them work without #22482.\r\n\r\nh3. @0004-Don-t-force-download-of-PDFs-but-show-in-browser-pre.patch@\r\n\r\nThe change updates @AttachmentsController@ and @RepositoryController@ to send PDF files with @content-disposition: inline@. (See first use case.)\r\n\r\nh3. @0005-Show-pdf-preview-for-repository-files-and-attachment.patch@\r\n\r\nThe change adds @attachments/pdf@ and @common/_pdf@ views to render PDF files in an iframe/object construct. (See second use case.)\r\n\r\nSince we cannot easily know the PDF\u2019s dimensions, the frame size follows the following rules:\r\n\r\n* it is as wide as possible (100%)\r\n* in general it is as high as it is wide\r\n* it is never higher than 80 % of the viewport (80vh), since we want to make sure, that there is always a bit of Redmine UI visible to avoid getting \u201ctrapped\u201d within the frame\r\n\r\nUsing a nested object/iframe structure was taken from http://pdfobject.com/static.html"}]}}

This way users preferring text parts and/or not aware of the new option do not need to see those parts in Redmine.\n\n-- Ticket2\n--Subject--\nSend individual notification mails per mail recipient\n\n--Description--\nWith this patch series, we are introducing the general concept to send multiple mails per notification event. Specifically, we are sending one mail per recipient user. Each of those mails is rendered in the context of the recipient (i.e. with @User.current@ set to the recipient). The mails can be sent immediately or optionally delayed using ActiveJob.\r\n\r\nThis approach has a couple of advantages over the existing approach of sending a single mail to multiple recipients:\r\n\r\n* We ensure object visibility for the rendered mails in the most generic way. Since each mail is rendered with @User.current@ set to the recipient, all content rendered in the mail (including shown issue attributes, macros and links in rendered textile text, ...) is guaranteed to only be visible to the user without having to ensure this manually for each mail using the same visibility rules as used for the HTML views already.\r\n* The mail will always be sent in the recipients language, even if multiple users with different languages are notified\r\n* There is no risk of the whole notification mail being rejected because of a single invalid recipient address (see #8157, #6829, #8733 and a lot of duplicates)\r\n\r\nIn the long run, it will also allow us to introduce user-specific additional information in the rendered notification, e.g. related issues, links to assign the issue, ...\r\n\r\nWith this new approach, we do have a some challenges which we are trying to address separately:\r\n\r\n* Since each mail is always rendered with an adapted @User.current@, any mail views which expected to use the original @User.current@ need to be adapted. In Redmine core, this only affects the security notifications.\r\n* Depending on the number of recipients for a notification, there might be many rendered mails which can take some time in the request. To ensure a snappy response, we can use ActiveJob to render and send the mails in the background. This can make the @async_*@ delivery methods obsolete.\r\n\r\nh2. Reminder: How mail sending works in plain Rails (and Redmine)\r\n\r\nThis patch series changes how mails are generated and delivered. Let's first look at how a mail normally gets generated and delivered in ActionMailer.\r\n\r\n* @mail = Mailer.news_added(news)@ - The user calls a class-method of the Mailer class (a child-class of ActionMailer::Base). This method is usually not implemented in the @Mailer@ class itself. Instead, there is a \"@method_missing@\":https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v5.1.2/actionmailer/lib/action_mailer/base.rb#L576-L582 method on @ActionMailer::Base@. Here, ActionMailer creates a @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object. Which is basically a delegator to an _eventually rendered_ mail object. Now, the mail is not actually rendered here. The @MessageDelivery@ object only collects all arguments it needs to eventually render the mail. This happens implicitly when any method on the mail is accessed (e.g. when the mail is about to be delivered). The @MessageDelivery@ delegator is returned to the user.\r\n\r\nNow that we have the (delegated) mail, we can deliver it with @mail.deliver@. This method used to be the only delivery method. With newer Rails versions, there is (with some variations) @deliver_now@ and @deliver_later@. Redmine usually calls @deliver@ which in source:trunk/config/initializers/10-patches.rb#L160 calls @deliver_now@ currently.\r\n\r\nWhen calling @mail.deliver@, the delegator starts to render the mail:\r\n\r\n* \"@MessageDelivery#processed_mailer@\":https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v5.1.3/actionmailer/lib/action_mailer/message_delivery.rb#L103-L107 creates a new @Mailer@ instance and calls @process@ on it.\r\n* @Mailer#process(:news_added, news)@ - The @process@ method is part of ActionMailer (and in turn part of the @ActionController@ framework on which ActionMailer is based on). Among things, it calls the specified action, i.e. the instance method.\r\n* @Mailer#news_added(news)@ - This instance method is implemented on the Mailer class and is responsible to render the actual mail message. Here, we set headers, instance variables for the view and basically do the usual controller stuff. With a final call to @mail@, we eventually render a single mail and return a @Mail::Message@ object.\r\n* This returned @Mail::Message@ object is delivered with a call to @Mail::Message#deliver_now@.\r\n\r\nh2. How we hook into this process\r\n\r\nNow, in order to send multiple mails, we hook into this process to render (and deliver) multiple mails. We want to ensure two things:\r\n\r\n* We want to create multiple mails, one per recipient and deliver them all in one go.\r\n* When rendering the mail (i.e. when calling the Mailer's instance method), we want to set @User.current@ to the recipient user and set it back to the original value after the rendering is done\r\n\r\nThese two goals are achieved with two specific changes to our Mailer:\r\n\r\nWe introduce a wrapper class called @Mailer::MultiMessage@. Instances of this class wrap multiple @Mail::Message@ objects (or rather @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ objects which delegate to @Mail::Message@ objects). The class provides the same @deliver_*@ methods as the original @Mail::Message@ objects. When calling such a method, we are calling it on each of the wrapped messages. This allows us to use an instance of this class in place of a @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object.\r\n\r\nWe use this class by implementing _class methods_ for each mailer action. These class methods implement the same external interface (i.e. accept the same arguments) as the old instance methods. This ensures that we keep the existing public interface. The class methods fetch the recipient users for the respective object (i.e. the issue, news, comment, ...). We use @Mailer::MultiMessage#for@ to add an @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object for each recipient which eventually renders the mail.\r\n\r\nWhen creating the delegator, we also pass the recipient user to the arguments for the mail rendering. We use this user in the overwritten @Mailer#process@ method to set @User.current@ and their language before actually rendering the message. This convention allows us to keep the interfaces clear: the user is only passed between the class method and @Mailer#process@ but doesn't need to be specified on the instance action. Here, it is already set as @User.current@ for each rendered mail.\r\n\r\nWe also extend @Mailer.method_missing@ (on the class) to create a single-mail @Mailer::MultiMessage@ object with the current user in case the class method for an action is not explicitly overwritten. This ensures that our convention of always passing a user to @Mailer#process@ is kept up even if a plugin only adds an instance method (which was valid before).\r\n\r\nh2. What we tried and did not work\r\n\r\nI first attempted to set the current user directly in the action's class method. and reset it directly afterwards. That would have made the code much more localized. However, due to the delayed rendering of the mail with the @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object, the mail will be rendered only after we have already reset the current user.\r\n\r\nOne way to work around this would be to introduce @deliver_*@ methods (like the now obsolete @Mailer.deliver_issue_add@ method). However doing so would have changed the intended external interface of our @Mailer@ class and would likely lead to integration pain with all existing Redmine plugins sending mail.\r\n\r\nh2. What we ship\r\n\r\nWe ship three patches here:\r\n\r\n* @0001-Send-individual-emails-for-each-mail-recipient.patch@ - The main implementation including tests.\r\n* @0002-Cleanup-Remove-Issue-each_notification-and-Journal-e.patch@ - Removes unneccessary methods for grouping recipients based on custom field visibility\r\n* @0003-Optional-Ensure-that-ActiveRecord-Base-objects-are-f.patch@ - An optional patch which changes the serialization behavior when sending mails with ActiveJob (e.g. with @Mailer.news_added(news).deliver_later@). By default, Rails serialized the arguments as a globalid (which is basically a reference to the object in the database identified by its ID). If there are concurrent changes to e.g. a newly created issue, this might result in notifications using the new state instead of the original state. With this patch, we serialize the exact attributes of the given objects into the job. Since this also causes nested attributes to be serialized along, care must be taken to avoid reference errors. In general, we should probably try to use mostly immutable state in the database where it is an important consideration that the notification state is exactly shown in the DB.\r\n\r\nh2. Future work\r\n\r\nh3. ActiveJob sending\r\n\r\nIf the general direction of this patch is accepted, it is probably desireable to move the mail sending to ActiveJob completely. This could replace the @async_*@ delivery methods [[EmailConfiguration#Asynchronous-delivery_methods|currently configurable]] in @configuration.yml@. This change can either be hardcoded in source:trunk/config/initializers/10-patches.rb#L160 or made configurable with a setting. I'll be glad to provide a patch for this. It would only be a few lines of code.\r\n\r\nBy default, we could use the in-process ActiveJob runner to send mails. More advanced users with a dedicated job worker (e.g. delayed job) can easily switch to that without changes to the Redmine code itself.\r\n\r\nh3. BCC recipients\r\n\r\nSince each user gets their own mail, we can probably remove the setting to send mails with BCC completely. If plugins want to send mails to non-user recipients, we would have to make sure to either set the recipients manually on BCC or group them appropriately. It is not a required setting in Redmine core anymore though."}]}}

Following a download link\r\n\r\nWhen following a download link, image are sent with @content-disposition: inline@, while all other files are sent with @attachment@. Since the some browsers is able to render PDF files directly (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, IE with Adobe Reader installed) and people are probably used to it, I think that extending this exception to PDF files is a reasonable change. If native PDF rendering within the browser is not supported, then a download will be initiated by the browser anyway.\r\n\r\nh3. 2. Displaying a PDF file in repository browser\r\n\r\nWhen accessing \"View\" within the file view in the repository browsers, Redmine currently forces a download of the PDF. Instead an iframe could be rendered which displays the PDF within the Redmine UI. Browser support for this use case is similar to No. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThe patch series is based on current trunk (r15332) plus the changes of #22482. If desired, I could isolate the changes further, to make them work without #22482.\r\n\r\nh3. @0004-Don-t-force-download-of-PDFs-but-show-in-browser-pre.patch@\r\n\r\nThe change updates @AttachmentsController@ and @RepositoryController@ to send PDF files with @content-disposition: inline@.

Usage\r\n\r\nThe attached patch extends the import configuration view with a new block, so that users may select a column for each relation type. The parent issue field also moved to the new block, since it's conceptually related.\r\n\r\nWithin the CSV file the columns may define multiple relations of the same type, each separated with @,@. Related issues follow the same rules as parent issues. A string preceded with a @#@ is supposed to be an existing issue. Without the @#@ it's supposed to be another row within the import file. For _follows_ and _precedes_ relations an additional delay may be present, e.g. @#12 3d@ specifying a relation to issue @#12@ and a delay of 3 days.\r\n\r\nh3. Technical notes\r\n\r\nSince issue relations may only be created when the issue was already saved, I've added a second step to the import. Additionally to @build_object@, which needs to be implemented by @Import@ sub classes, there's also a @extend_object@ method now. This is used by the @IssueImporter@ to save the relations after the issue was already saved successfully.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Additional considerations\r\n\r\nInitially, I wanted to build the import, so that issue relations exported from Redmine could be imported directly. But the format that's used by the exporter was designed for humans, not so much for computers. Most importantly, to parse this format we would need to grep for the localized relation names, which might even change between versions of Redmine. Therefore I settled for the proposed approach of having separate columns for each relation type."}]}}

Many email relays which require a user-id/pw login (e.g. smtp.gmail.com) replace the sender@domain with the user-id of the login account.

This allows replies to be routed to the redmine instance where they originated, and be incorporated into the issue.\r\n\r\nThe attached tarball of .diff files is for:\r\n  redmine-4.1.1\r\n  ruby 2.6.6p146  (not relevant)\r\n  Rails 5.2.4.2   (provides base mailer, not especially relevant)\r\n  mysql 5.7       (not relevant)\r\n  plugins: Additionals (not relevant)"}]}}

Usage\r\n\r\nThe attached patch extends the import configuration view with a new block, so that users may select a column for each relation type. The parent issue field also moved to the new block, since it's conceptually related.\r\n\r\nWithin the CSV file the columns may define multiple relations of the same type, each separated with @,@. Related issues follow the same rules as parent issues. A string preceded with a @#@ is supposed to be an existing issue. Without the @#@ it's supposed to be another row within the import file. For _follows_ and _precedes_ relations an additional delay may be present, e.g. @#12 3d@ specifying a relation to issue @#12@ and a delay of 3 days.\r\n\r\nh3. Technical notes\r\n\r\nSince issue relations may only be created when the issue was already saved, I've added a second step to the import. Additionally to @build_object@, which needs to be implemented by @Import@ sub classes, there's also a @extend_object@ method now. This is used by the @IssueImporter@ to save the relations after the issue was already saved successfully.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Additional considerations\r\n\r\nInitially, I wanted to build the import, so that issue relations exported from Redmine could be imported directly. But the format that's used by the exporter was designed for humans, not so much for computers.

This is especially true for open source projects communities.\r\n* some people may not like to be *forced to resign from their privacy*. When user is forced to provide data he does not want to, he will probably provide fake data. Value of fake data is not greater that that of no data. This is related to #28106.\r\n* there is already option in Redmine to set *user display format to login only* (instead of first/last name).\r\n* some jurisdictions may require sites that *gather personal data to comply with specific laws*. Again if Redmine is used by open source project communities it may place an unnecessary burden on site administrators.\r\n* some communities largely make *use of only one name* and requiring 2 names is requiring impossible. Related: #1595\r\n\r\nI propose to either:\r\n# Make first and last name optional\r\nor\r\n# Add administrative setting to control whether first and last names are optional or required."}]}}

Currently, there are three methods of API authentication:\r\n\r\n1. send the user's API key via X-Redmine-API-Key header\r\n2. basic authentication with the user's API key ( username is the API key and password is a random string)\r\n3. basic authentication with user name and password\r\n\r\nIf you have two-factor authentication enabled, I think the third method will be problematic. This is because even though the web UI can prevent an attacker from logging in with an illegally obtained username and password, they can still use that username and password to access the data via the API.\r\n\r\nTo address this risk, I suggest disabling basic authentication with username and password for users who have two-factor authentication enabled.\r\n"}]}}

With these 2 new filters you can cover most of the use cases related to target version. \r\nSome examples:\r\n- a query that returns all the issues that are assigned in open versions\r\n- a query that returns all the issues that are assigned in versions with due date\r\n\r\nThe attached patch:\r\n- implements these new 2 filters\r\n- groups the target version status and target version due date with target version's custom fields under the label Target Version . I wasn't sure that is a good idea to move also the existing target version filter (name) to this group. (attached target_version_group.png)\r\n- adds 2 new tests\r\n- breaks an existing tests (QueryTest#test_total_by_project_group_for_spent_hours), but  I'm not sure how to fix the problem. The respective test have also a to do comment to remove some code after this \"issue\":https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/21922 is fixed (and is was fixed). \r\n\r\nI think that this ticket is related to #21249  \r\n"}]}}

Tracker A that are assigned to Paul and Tracker B that are assigned to John. You need to see both of these side-by-side to be able to compare the due dates between the two and take action as needed.\r\nYou define your first \"query\"/filter by filtering for Tracker: \"A\" and Assigned to: \"Paul\". After that, you click a \"+\" icon below the filter/options that adds another set of filter/options and you can define your second \"query\"/filter by setting Tracker: \"B\" and Assigned to: \"John\". Click apply and it will run both queries, distinct & union the result set and display accordingly. The displayed columns would be shared between all issues.\r\n\r\nThis could also lead into some sort of combined custom query searching capability if that is something you guys want to explore.\r\n\r\n----"}]}}

See \"Planio filters just got more powerful - Planio Support &#40;english&#41; - Planio Support\":https://support.plan.io/news/200\r\n\n\n-- Ticket2\n--Subject--\nEscape values in LIKE statements to prevent injection of placeholders (_ or %)\n\n--Description--\nWhile not technically a security risk, LIKE queries with lots of placeholders can result in high database load, very slow query execution and therefore are a possible vector for denial of service attacks. Further, escaping the wildcard characters in actual query values now allows to actually search for values containing these characters.\r\n\r\nThe attached patches, which have been extracted from \"Planio\":https://plan.io/redmine-hosting are:\r\n\r\n* The first patch removes '%' signs from query strings used in the search test case. These did not matter until now since they just resulted in queries like @field LIKE '%%value%%'@, but now would be looking for a value with literal percent signs. Tests pass before and after that change.\r\n* Patches 2-4 add @sanitize_sql_like@ calls to the various places where we currrently generate sql LIKE statements. Corresponding tests are included.\r\n* The last patch is just a cosmetic change that replaces a @.send@ with a direct call since the called method is now public.\r\n"}]}}

This makes it impossible to provide consistent behavior for plugins implementing edit_after_save controller hooks.\r\n\r\nSay, a user edits an issue via issue view and triggers a @issue_edit_after_save_hook@ which handles the issue in a proper way. The same is expected to happen when an issue is edited via context menu (right click) in any multiple issues view, but there is no way to provide that as @bulk_edit@ method is called for context menus and there is no @issue_bulk_edit_after_save@ hook which makes @issue_edit_after_save@ hook useless.\r\n\r\nI think it would be useful to have something like this in issues#bulk_edit controller method:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\ndef bulk_edit\r\n  ...\r\n  @issues.each do |orig_issue|\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    begin        \r\n      Issue.transaction do          \r\n        call_hook(:controller_issues_bulk_edit_before_save, { :params => params, :issue => issue })          \r\n        issue.save!          \r\n        call_hook(:controller_issues_bulk_edit_after_save,  { :params => params, :issue => issue })          \r\n      end        \r\n    saved_issues << issue\r\n    rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotSaved => e        \r\n      unsaved_issues << orig_issue\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n  end\r\n  ...\r\nend\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nHope someone can make a proper patch out of this or provide a better way of managing after_save hooks for bulk edit.

This Authenticated user group is assigned to every public project with the 'Associated' role but as the number of workflow permutations is a function trackers X roles, a new role requires configuring (and maintaining) an additional workflow for each tracker.\r\n\r\nThis work around gives us the results we need but it also requires an additional step to ensure each user gets put into the 'Authenticated user' group.\r\n\r\nWhile this work around is more or less acceptable, it would be friendlier if the issue Assignee selection list on the New Issue view and the add watcher list on the update issue view could be sorted and grouped by roles. Or better yet, sorted by roles and have the roles expandable/collapsable! Also, the issue Watcher list on the New Issue view would also be more friendly if it also were a select list as on the update issue view or at least expandable/collapsable as described above.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"}]}}
