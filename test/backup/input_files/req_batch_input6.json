Specifically, we are sending one mail per recipient user. Each of those mails is rendered in the context of the recipient (i.e. with @User.current@ set to the recipient). The mails can be sent immediately or optionally delayed using ActiveJob.\r\n\r\nThis approach has a couple of advantages over the existing approach of sending a single mail to multiple recipients:\r\n\r\n* We ensure object visibility for the rendered mails in the most generic way. Since each mail is rendered with @User.current@ set to the recipient, all content rendered in the mail (including shown issue attributes, macros and links in rendered textile text, ...) is guaranteed to only be visible to the user without having to ensure this manually for each mail using the same visibility rules as used for the HTML views already.\r\n* The mail will always be sent in the recipients language, even if multiple users with different languages are notified\r\n* There is no risk of the whole notification mail being rejected because of a single invalid recipient address (see #8157, #6829, #8733 and a lot of duplicates)\r\n\r\nIn the long run, it will also allow us to introduce user-specific additional information in the rendered notification, e.g. related issues, links to assign the issue, ...\r\n\r\nWith this new approach, we do have a some challenges which we are trying to address separately:\r\n\r\n* Since each mail is always rendered with an adapted @User.current@, any mail views which expected to use the original @User.current@ need to be adapted. In Redmine core, this only affects the security notifications.\r\n* Depending on the number of recipients for a notification, there might be many rendered mails which can take some time in the request. To ensure a snappy response, we can use ActiveJob to render and send the mails in the background. This can make the @async_*@ delivery methods obsolete.\r\n\r\nh2. Reminder: How mail sending works in plain Rails (and Redmine)\r\n\r\nThis patch series changes how mails are generated and delivered. Let's first look at how a mail normally gets generated and delivered in ActionMailer.\r\n\r\n* @mail = Mailer.news_added(news)@ - The user calls a class-method of the Mailer class (a child-class of ActionMailer::Base). This method is usually not implemented in the @Mailer@ class itself. Instead, there is a \"@method_missing@\":https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v5.1.2/actionmailer/lib/action_mailer/base.rb#L576-L582 method on @ActionMailer::Base@. Here, ActionMailer creates a @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object. Which is basically a delegator to an _eventually rendered_ mail object. Now, the mail is not actually rendered here. The @MessageDelivery@ object only collects all arguments it needs to eventually render the mail. This happens implicitly when any method on the mail is accessed (e.g. when the mail is about to be delivered). The @MessageDelivery@ delegator is returned to the user.\r\n\r\nNow that we have the (delegated) mail, we can deliver it with @mail.deliver@. This method used to be the only delivery method. With newer Rails versions, there is (with some variations) @deliver_now@ and @deliver_later@. Redmine usually calls @deliver@ which in source:trunk/config/initializers/10-patches.rb#L160 calls @deliver_now@ currently.\r\n\r\nWhen calling @mail.deliver@, the delegator starts to render the mail:\r\n\r\n* \"@MessageDelivery#processed_mailer@\":https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v5.1.3/actionmailer/lib/action_mailer/message_delivery.rb#L103-L107 creates a new @Mailer@ instance and calls @process@ on it.\r\n* @Mailer#process(:news_added, news)@ - The @process@ method is part of ActionMailer (and in turn part of the @ActionController@ framework on which ActionMailer is based on). Among things, it calls the specified action, i.e. the instance method.\r\n* @Mailer#news_added(news)@ - This instance method is implemented on the Mailer class and is responsible to render the actual mail message. Here, we set headers, instance variables for the view and basically do the usual controller stuff. With a final call to @mail@, we eventually render a single mail and return a @Mail::Message@ object.\r\n* This returned @Mail::Message@ object is delivered with a call to @Mail::Message#deliver_now@.\r\n\r\nh2. How we hook into this process\r\n\r\nNow, in order to send multiple mails, we hook into this process to render (and deliver) multiple mails. We want to ensure two things:\r\n\r\n* We want to create multiple mails, one per recipient and deliver them all in one go.\r\n* When rendering the mail (i.e. when calling the Mailer's instance method), we want to set @User.current@ to the recipient user and set it back to the original value after the rendering is done\r\n\r\nThese two goals are achieved with two specific changes to our Mailer:\r\n\r\nWe introduce a wrapper class called @Mailer::MultiMessage@. Instances of this class wrap multiple @Mail::Message@ objects (or rather @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ objects which delegate to @Mail::Message@ objects). The class provides the same @deliver_*@ methods as the original @Mail::Message@ objects. When calling such a method, we are calling it on each of the wrapped messages. This allows us to use an instance of this class in place of a @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object.\r\n\r\nWe use this class by implementing _class methods_ for each mailer action. These class methods implement the same external interface (i.e. accept the same arguments) as the old instance methods. This ensures that we keep the existing public interface. The class methods fetch the recipient users for the respective object (i.e. the issue, news, comment, ...). We use @Mailer::MultiMessage#for@ to add an @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object for each recipient which eventually renders the mail.\r\n\r\nWhen creating the delegator, we also pass the recipient user to the arguments for the mail rendering. We use this user in the overwritten @Mailer#process@ method to set @User.current@ and their language before actually rendering the message. This convention allows us to keep the interfaces clear: the user is only passed between the class method and @Mailer#process@ but doesn't need to be specified on the instance action. Here, it is already set as @User.current@ for each rendered mail.\r\n\r\nWe also extend @Mailer.method_missing@ (on the class) to create a single-mail @Mailer::MultiMessage@ object with the current user in case the class method for an action is not explicitly overwritten. This ensures that our convention of always passing a user to @Mailer#process@ is kept up even if a plugin only adds an instance method (which was valid before).\r\n\r\nh2. What we tried and did not work\r\n\r\nI first attempted to set the current user directly in the action's class method. and reset it directly afterwards. That would have made the code much more localized. However, due to the delayed rendering of the mail with the @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object, the mail will be rendered only after we have already reset the current user.\r\n\r\nOne way to work around this would be to introduce @deliver_*@ methods (like the now obsolete @Mailer.deliver_issue_add@ method). However doing so would have changed the intended external interface of our @Mailer@ class and would likely lead to integration pain with all existing Redmine plugins sending mail.\r\n\r\nh2. What we ship\r\n\r\nWe ship three patches here:\r\n\r\n* @0001-Send-individual-emails-for-each-mail-recipient.patch@ - The main implementation including tests.\r\n* @0002-Cleanup-Remove-Issue-each_notification-and-Journal-e.patch@ - Removes unneccessary methods for grouping recipients based on custom field visibility\r\n* @0003-Optional-Ensure-that-ActiveRecord-Base-objects-are-f.patch@ - An optional patch which changes the serialization behavior when sending mails with ActiveJob (e.g. with @Mailer.news_added(news).deliver_later@). By default, Rails serialized the arguments as a globalid (which is basically a reference to the object in the database identified by its ID). If there are concurrent changes to e.g. a newly created issue, this might result in notifications using the new state instead of the original state. With this patch, we serialize the exact attributes of the given objects into the job. Since this also causes nested attributes to be serialized along, care must be taken to avoid reference errors. In general, we should probably try to use mostly immutable state in the database where it is an important consideration that the notification state is exactly shown in the DB.\r\n\r\nh2. Future work\r\n\r\nh3. ActiveJob sending\r\n\r\nIf the general direction of this patch is accepted, it is probably desireable to move the mail sending to ActiveJob completely. This could replace the @async_*@ delivery methods [[EmailConfiguration#Asynchronous-delivery_methods|currently configurable]] in @configuration.yml@. This change can either be hardcoded in source:trunk/config/initializers/10-patches.rb#L160 or made configurable with a setting. I'll be glad to provide a patch for this. It would only be a few lines of code.\r\n\r\nBy default, we could use the in-process ActiveJob runner to send mails. More advanced users with a dedicated job worker (e.g. delayed job) can easily switch to that without changes to the Redmine code itself.\r\n\r\nh3. BCC recipients\r\n\r\nSince each user gets their own mail, we can probably remove the setting to send mails with BCC completely. If plugins want to send mails to non-user recipients, we would have to make sure to either set the recipients manually on BCC or group them appropriately. It is not a required setting in Redmine core anymore though."}]}}

Usage\r\n\r\nThe attached patch extends the import configuration view with a new block, so that users may select a column for each relation type. The parent issue field also moved to the new block, since it's conceptually related.\r\n\r\nWithin the CSV file the columns may define multiple relations of the same type, each separated with @,@. Related issues follow the same rules as parent issues. A string preceded with a @#@ is supposed to be an existing issue. Without the @#@ it's supposed to be another row within the import file. For _follows_ and _precedes_ relations an additional delay may be present, e.g. @#12 3d@ specifying a relation to issue @#12@ and a delay of 3 days.\r\n\r\nh3. Technical notes\r\n\r\nSince issue relations may only be created when the issue was already saved, I've added a second step to the import. Additionally to @build_object@, which needs to be implemented by @Import@ sub classes, there's also a @extend_object@ method now. This is used by the @IssueImporter@ to save the relations after the issue was already saved successfully.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Additional considerations\r\n\r\nInitially, I wanted to build the import, so that issue relations exported from Redmine could be imported directly. But the format that's used by the exporter was designed for humans, not so much for computers. Most importantly, to parse this format we would need to grep for the localized relation names, which might even change between versions of Redmine. Therefore I settled for the proposed approach of having separate columns for each relation type."}]}}

We can add watchers, but of course, they do not see the issue.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, setting the issue visibility to \"All non private issues\" would allow them to see too much tickets.\r\n\r\nSo a combination would be great: general setting for visibility is \"Issues created by or assigned to the user\" but with the exceptional case, if a person is assigned as watcher.\r\nIt should be possible, that the watcher can see those issues, he has been added to.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."}]}}

Proposal\r\n\r\nIn Redmine4.0, other destinations are no longer displayed in the notification email.\r\n\r\nThis is a side effect of the following changes in Redmine 4.0.\r\nhttps://redmine.org/issues/26791\r\n\r\nDepending on the contents of the ticket, it may be necessary to confirm who is notified.\r\nFor example, the response may change depending on whether the trouble ticket content is delivered to the CEO.\r\n\r\nIn Redmine3.4, it was found from the To / Cc column of the notification email that the email was sent to someone else.\r\nIn Redmine 4.0 or later, you can not understand without checking the ticket.\r\n\r\nAlso, the amount sent to the person who has been set to \"notify all\" in the personal settings cannot be confirmed on the ticket.\r\n\r\nh1. Solution\r\n\r\nThere is no problem in sending individual emails.\r\nThe only inconvenience is that you can no longer check the simultaneous notification destination directly from the email.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the conventional To / Cc (watch) can be added to the beginning of the email text by setting the individual ID unit.\r\n\r\nh1. Supplement\r\n\r\nIn Redmine3.X, there was a side effect that other destinations could be known by batch mailing. (Specification changed in 4.0)\r\nIt seems that it was not recognized that there were cases where this was used as a substantial function.\r\n(In some cases, it may be necessary to respond depending on the email notification destination)\r\n\r\nYou can tell by checking the ticket from the link on the notification email, but it will be a burden if there are many cases.\r\n\r\n/* The following is a Japanese supplement */\r\n\r\nRedmine\u306e\u901a\u77e5\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u3001\u4ed6\u306e\u5b9b\u5148\u3092\u8868\u793a\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3059\u308b\r\n\r\n\u25a0\u63d0\u6848\u5185\u5bb9\r\n\r\nRedmine4.0\u306b\u3066\u3001\u901a\u77e5\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u4ed6\u306e\u5b9b\u5148\u304c\u8868\u793a\u3055\u308c\u306a\u304f\u306a\u3063\u305f\u3002\r\n\r\n\u3053\u308c\u306fRedmine4.0\u306e\u4e0b\u8a18\u5909\u66f4\u306b\u3088\u308b\u526f\u4f5c\u7528\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3002\r\nhttps://redmine.org/issues/26791\r\n\r\n\u30c1\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u5185\u5bb9\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u306f\u3001\u4ed6\u306e\u8ab0\u306b\u901a\u77e5\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304b\u78ba\u8a8d\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u5834\u5408\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3002\r\n\u4f8b\u3048\u3070\u3001\u30c8\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u306e\u30c1\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u5185\u5bb9\u304cCEO\u306b\u914d\u4fe1\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304b\u3069\u3046\u304b\u3067\u3001\u5bfe\u5fdc\u304c\u5909\u308f\u308b\u5834\u5408\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3002\r\n\r\nRedmine3.4\u306e\u6642\u306f\u3001\u901a\u77e5\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb\u306eTo/Cc\u6b04\u304b\u3089\u3001\u4ed6\u306e\u8ab0\u306b\u9001\u4fe1\u3055\u308c\u305f\u304b\u5224\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001\r\nRedmine4.0\u4ee5\u964d\u3067\u306f\u30c1\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u78ba\u8a8d\u3057\u306a\u3044\u3068\u5224\u3089\u306a\u3044\u3002\r\n\r\n\u307e\u305f\u3001\u500b\u4eba\u8a2d\u5b9a\u3067\u300c\u3059\u3079\u3066\u901a\u77e5\u300d\u306b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u4eba\u3078\u306e\u9001\u4fe1\u5206\u306f\u3001\u30c1\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u4e0a\u304b\u3089\u78ba\u8a8d\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u3002\r\n\r\n\u25a0\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56\r\n\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u500b\u5225\u9001\u4fe1\u81ea\u4f53\u306b\u306f\u554f\u984c\u306a\u3044\u3002\r\n\u540c\u6642\u901a\u77e5\u5148\u3092\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb\u304b\u3089\u76f4\u63a5\u78ba\u8a8d\u3067\u304d\u306a\u304f\u306a\u3063\u305f\u306e\u304c\u4e0d\u4fbf\u306a\u3060\u3051\u3002\r\n\r\n\u500b\u4ebaID\u5358\u4f4d\u306e\u8a2d\u5b9a\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u5f93\u6765\u306eTo/Cc(watch) \u3092\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb\u30c6\u30ad\u30b9\u30c8\u5148\u982d\u306b\u4ed8\u3051\u3089\u308c\u308c\u3070\u826f\u3044\u3068\u601d\u308f\u308c\u308b\u3002\r\n\r\n\u25a0\u88dc\u8db3\r\nRedmine3.X\u3067\u306f\u3001\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb\u4e00\u62ec\u9001\u4fe1\u306b\u3088\u308a\u4ed6\u306e\u9001\u4fe1\u5148\u304c\u5224\u308b\u3068\u3044\u3046\u526f\u4f5c\u7528\u304c\u3042\u3063\u305f\u3002\uff084.0\u3067\u4ed5\u69d8\u5909\u66f4\uff09\r\n\u3053\u308c\u3092\u5b9f\u8cea\u7684\u306a\u6a5f\u80fd\u3068\u3057\u3066\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u5834\u5408\u304c\u3042\u3063\u305f\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3001\u8a8d\u8b58\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3068\u601d\u308f\u308c\u308b\u3002\r\n\uff08\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb\u901a\u77e5\u5148\u306b\u3088\u308a\u5bfe\u5fdc\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u3082\u3042\u308b\uff09\r\n\r\n\u901a\u77e5\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb\u4e0a\u306e\u30ea\u30f3\u30af\u304b\u3089\u30c1\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u78ba\u8a8d\u3059\u308c\u3070\u5224\u308b\u304c\u3001\u4ef6\u6570\u304c\u591a\u3051\u308c\u3070\u8ca0\u62c5\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3002\r\n\r\n\u672c\u30c1\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u5bfe\u5fdc\u306f\u4e0b\u8a18\u306b\u8a18\u8f09\u3057\u307e\u3059\r\nhttps://redmine.tokyo/issues/1083\r\n"}]}}

Many email relays which require a user-id/pw login (e.g. smtp.gmail.com) replace the sender@domain with the user-id of the login account.  Consequently, when the receiver replies to the email, it goes to the login user-id and domain, rather than the sender user@domain set by redmine where the issue originated.\r\n\r\nThis patch provides a check-box in the email-notifications settings which, when set, causes redmine to provide a reply-to header identical to the sender (user@domain).  This allows replies to be routed to the redmine instance where they originated, and be incorporated into the issue.\r\n\r\nThe attached tarball of .diff files is for:\r\n  redmine-4.1.1\r\n  ruby 2.6.6p146  (not relevant)\r\n  Rails 5.2.4.2   (provides base mailer, not especially relevant)\r\n  mysql 5.7       (not relevant)\r\n  plugins: Additionals (not relevant)"}]}}

Currently, when rendering an issue PDF, macros are only expanded in the description, but not when rendering custom fields with fulltext formatting enabled. The patch changes the behaviour so that formatted full-width custom fields are rendered in the same way the description is rendered, fully interpreting macros. The behaviour for rendering normal-width custom fields is unchanged, probably it is better to leave it as is due to space constraints.\r\n2. Thumbnail macro output was not rendered properly (in the issue description and elsewhere) because the thumbnail image file could not be retrieved - the second patch extends @get_image_filename@ to check for thumbnail URLs and retrieve the proper file path in that case.\r\n\r\nBoth patches were initially developed for \"Planio\":https://plan.io/redmine-hosting ."}]}}

They could e.g. lack both a priority and a subject altogether or lack a priority and substitute the subject attribute with a title or name attribute in the form of a custom field.\r\n\r\nI think it would be great if Redmine could support such configurations without the need for users/admins to resort to (custom) workarounds. That way, the bare minimum of issue attributes would consist of only the status attribute (by disabling all the fields in the tracker config combined with setting the remaining fields to read-only in the workflow field permissions).\r\n\r\nUse-case examples:\r\n* collection management (books/movies/CDs/DVDs/BDs/recipes, etc.)\r\n* (software) license management\r\n* inventory management\r\n* contact management\r\n* vacation-/presence management\r\n* appointment management\r\n* etc.\r\n\r\nIn the case that such entities are tracked as Redmine issues, an administrator can already modify/override the respective Redmine core translations easily via a plugin to globally rename 'issues' into a more general term like 'items'. This cannot be done with the same ease to e.g. rename the subject attribute to a title attribute as issues of other trackers (e.g. an old-school defect tracker) use the same attribute OOTB, hence the request to also make the subject attribute disablable."}]}}

Tracker A that are assigned to Paul and Tracker B that are assigned to John. You need to see both of these side-by-side to be able to compare the due dates between the two and take action as needed.\r\nYou define your first \"query\"/filter by filtering for Tracker: \"A\" and Assigned to: \"Paul\". After that, you click a \"+\" icon below the filter/options that adds another set of filter/options and you can define your second \"query\"/filter by setting Tracker: \"B\" and Assigned to: \"John\". Click apply and it will run both queries, distinct & union the result set and display accordingly. The displayed columns would be shared between all issues.\r\n\r\nThis could also lead into some sort of combined custom query searching capability if that is something you guys want to explore.\r\n\r\n----"}]}}

With these 2 new filters you can cover most of the use cases related to target version. \r\nSome examples:\r\n- a query that returns all the issues that are assigned in open versions\r\n- a query that returns all the issues that are assigned in versions with due date\r\n\r\nThe attached patch:\r\n- implements these new 2 filters\r\n- groups the target version status and target version due date with target version's custom fields under the label Target Version . I wasn't sure that is a good idea to move also the existing target version filter (name) to this group. (attached target_version_group.png)\r\n- adds 2 new tests\r\n- breaks an existing tests (QueryTest#test_total_by_project_group_for_spent_hours), but  I'm not sure how to fix the problem. The respective test have also a to do comment to remove some code after this \"issue\":https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/21922 is fixed (and is was fixed). \r\n\r\nI think that this ticket is related to #21249  \r\n"}]}}

The first thing that I stumbled upon was that the 'View all issues' link in the issues sidebar was removed in r18304. Although I see the merit of its removal with #30294, it really annoys me not having that link available (to such an extend that I quickly created a \"small plugin\":/plugins/redmine_add_all_issues_link_in_issues_sidebar to restore it on the issues show view).\r\nThe reason for this annoyance is that it was the only way to clear the current, not-saved query straight from the issues show view without first going back to the issues index view and then subsequently clicking on the clear button. With the link on issues show it is possible to go back to the default issues list without the need of an additional click on the clear button to clear the in-memory query. All the other (currently available) links that go back to the issues index view (project menu and query links on the index show view) retain the current query.\r\n\r\nSo, to make a long story short, I'd like to request a reconsideration of the decision for the removal of this link. This is also rooted in the fact that I think more (power) users will be/have been bitten by this change.\r\n\r\nFTR:\r\n* I have no problems with the move of the other links ('Summary' and 'Import') to the drop-down menu. This request is just about the 'View all issues' link.\r\n* I haven't looked into the changes of the 'Spent time' sidebar yet, but the points of the 'Issues sidebar' might also apply to those views.\r\n* If the removal decision is indeed reverted then it would be viable to subsequently also revert the addition of the clear query buttons added in #31640, as they would become obsolete if the 'View all issues' link is added back in.\r\n* I am also ok if my request will be declined. I'll then just keep using my plugin to restore the old situation...\r\n"}]}}

Tracker A that are assigned to Paul and Tracker B that are assigned to John. You need to see both of these side-by-side to be able to compare the due dates between the two and take action as needed.\r\nYou define your first \"query\"/filter by filtering for Tracker: \"A\" and Assigned to: \"Paul\". After that, you click a \"+\" icon below the filter/options that adds another set of filter/options and you can define your second \"query\"/filter by setting Tracker: \"B\" and Assigned to: \"John\". Click apply and it will run both queries, distinct & union the result set and display accordingly. The displayed columns would be shared between all issues.\r\n\r\nThis could also lead into some sort of combined custom query searching capability if that is something you guys want to explore.\r\n\r\n----"}]}}

Otherwise the relation will be ignored.\r\n\r\nTo work around this limitation, the issue import could be extended to use multiple passes:\r\n\r\n# one to import basic issue properties\r\n# one to import relations to other issues\r\n\r\nThis way it becomes easier to create the CSV files for imports, since order is no longer important.\r\n\r\nThis change would also be a prerequisite to import general issue relations. Since those cannot be more complex that parent relations and cannot necessarily be linearized properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAttached you find a patch series based on trunk r15361.\r\n\r\nWhile implemented the changes, I tried to keep the @Import@ free from issue related information. Other existing @Import@ sub classes - within plugins e.g. - should need as little updates as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. 0001 Extend test data for issue import\r\n\r\nThis change adds two rows to the existing issue import fixture file. These rows contain a parent and a child issue, while the parent is placed after the child. This would not import properly given the current implementation.\r\n\r\nThe patch also updates the existing tests, where the number of imported issues is asserted.\r\n\r\nh3. 0002 Add test for issue relations to following rows\r\n\r\nThis patch extends the existing parent issue import test to also verify that the newly introduced parent child relation is properly imported. This test fails with the current implementation.\r\n\r\nh3. 0003 Multi-pass CSV import\r\n\r\nThis patch defines a @required_passes@ method within @Import@ which returns @1@ by default and may be overwritten in sub classes. The @IssueImport@ does so and returns @1@ if no @parent_id@ mapping was set, otherwise it returns @2@.\r\n\r\nThe @run@ method is split into @run@ and @run_pass@. The first one is recursive and called once for each pass. It also handles the @max_*@ options. The second is only responsible for reading the rows, creating or updating the ImportItems and passing everything to @build_object@.\r\n\r\nSince @build_object@ may now be called multiple times (once for each pass), the argument list was extended to provide more context. If somebody created a custom import in a plugin, this would need to be changed by the plugin's author.\r\n\r\nIn the @IssueImport@, @build_object@ is now split into @build_issue@ and @build_relations@, the first is called in the first pass, the second in pass 2.\r\n\r\nThe patch also contains a migration, which adds a @completed_passes@ field to @ImportItem@. This is needed to properly (re-)store progress for multi-step imports, like the ones via the web UI.\r\n\r\nFinally the patch adds some test to make sure, that the general behavior of multi-step imports did not change with the introduction of multi-pass imports.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Disclaimer*: I know, this is a rather large change to fix a minor nuisance. But as mentioned earlier, I think, this change is a necessary prerequisite to support importing \"Related Issues\" properly, which I would like to contribute next, if this patch is accepted."}]}}

Usage\r\n\r\nThe attached patch extends the import configuration view with a new block, so that users may select a column for each relation type. The parent issue field also moved to the new block, since it's conceptually related.\r\n\r\nWithin the CSV file the columns may define multiple relations of the same type, each separated with @,@. Related issues follow the same rules as parent issues. A string preceded with a @#@ is supposed to be an existing issue. Without the @#@ it's supposed to be another row within the import file. For _follows_ and _precedes_ relations an additional delay may be present, e.g. @#12 3d@ specifying a relation to issue @#12@ and a delay of 3 days.\r\n\r\nh3. Technical notes\r\n\r\nSince issue relations may only be created when the issue was already saved, I've added a second step to the import. Additionally to @build_object@, which needs to be implemented by @Import@ sub classes, there's also a @extend_object@ method now. This is used by the @IssueImporter@ to save the relations after the issue was already saved successfully.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Additional considerations\r\n\r\nInitially, I wanted to build the import, so that issue relations exported from Redmine could be imported directly. But the format that's used by the exporter was designed for humans, not so much for computers. Most importantly, to parse this format we would need to grep for the localized relation names, which might even change between versions of Redmine. Therefore I settled for the proposed approach of having separate columns for each relation type."}]}}

But since Redmine currently only supports issue imports, there are now some places, where assumptions about the issue import are hard-coded.\r\n\r\nThere are some plugins out there, which add other kinds of CSV imports to Redmine, but none of them seems to use the imports controller. I assume, it's because of the shortcomings mentioned above. I wanted to improve this situation, so I decided to build a time entry importer and - along the way - generalize the imports controller so that it's able to handle more than just issues.\r\n\r\nh3. Preparations\r\n\r\nThe first patch attached extracts the issue related view parts into partials which are determined by convention. They are all prefixed with the imported model name, i.e. @_issues@. \r\n\r\nThe issue related model parts are moved to the import model. Those are, e.g. the proper menu item, the authorization or the layout. Strictly speaking they should be located on the controller level, but I did not want to build sub classes of the imports controller for each and every kind of import.\r\n\r\nh3. Adding the time entry import\r\n\r\nThe second patch attached adds the time entry import. It's using the newly introduced extension points to fill in the blanks. To provide a way for the user to find the new import, I've added the @timelog/_sidebar@ partial, similar to the one for issues. This new sidebar partial is now used in the timelog views and it contains a link to the import.\r\n\r\n*Note:* within said partial, I've mis/re-used an i18n key @label_time_entries_visibility_all@ since it was providing the desired text in German and English. I did not want to introduce a new key based on the existing one, since that would have probably caused major merge problems. If desired, I may of course do that anyway.\r\n\r\nh3. Closing notes\r\n\r\nThe second patch may of course also become a plugin. The main point of this patch (series) was it, to allow plugins to reuse the existing plugin infrastructure. Without the first patch though, a plugin author would need copy most of the views and functionality of the imports class, which is undesirable (at least for the plugin author).\r\n\r\nThank you for considering these patches."}]}}

Following a download link\r\n\r\nWhen following a download link, image are sent with @content-disposition: inline@, while all other files are sent with @attachment@. Since the some browsers is able to render PDF files directly (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, IE with Adobe Reader installed) and people are probably used to it, I think that extending this exception to PDF files is a reasonable change. If native PDF rendering within the browser is not supported, then a download will be initiated by the browser anyway.\r\n\r\nh3. 2. Displaying a PDF file in repository browser\r\n\r\nWhen accessing \"View\" within the file view in the repository browsers, Redmine currently forces a download of the PDF. Instead an iframe could be rendered which displays the PDF within the Redmine UI. Browser support for this use case is similar to No. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThe patch series is based on current trunk (r15332) plus the changes of #22482. If desired, I could isolate the changes further, to make them work without #22482.\r\n\r\nh3. @0004-Don-t-force-download-of-PDFs-but-show-in-browser-pre.patch@\r\n\r\nThe change updates @AttachmentsController@ and @RepositoryController@ to send PDF files with @content-disposition: inline@. (See first use case.)\r\n\r\nh3. @0005-Show-pdf-preview-for-repository-files-and-attachment.patch@\r\n\r\nThe change adds @attachments/pdf@ and @common/_pdf@ views to render PDF files in an iframe/object construct. (See second use case.)\r\n\r\nSince we cannot easily know the PDF\u2019s dimensions, the frame size follows the following rules:\r\n\r\n* it is as wide as possible (100%)\r\n* in general it is as high as it is wide\r\n* it is never higher than 80 % of the viewport (80vh), since we want to make sure, that there is always a bit of Redmine UI visible to avoid getting \u201ctrapped\u201d within the frame\r\n\r\nUsing a nested object/iframe structure was taken from http://pdfobject.com/static.html"}]}}

The behaviour for rendering normal-width custom fields is unchanged, probably it is better to leave it as is due to space constraints.\r\n2. Thumbnail macro output was not rendered properly (in the issue description and elsewhere) because the thumbnail image file could not be retrieved - the second patch extends @get_image_filename@ to check for thumbnail URLs and retrieve the proper file path in that case.\r\n\r\nBoth patches were initially developed for \"Planio\":https://plan.io/redmine-hosting ."}]}}

Yet, this assumption should be checked..._\r\n\r\nCurrently, the \r\n* view for repo (changeset/revision) diffs provides diff content in _descending_ alphabetical order; while the\r\n* view for diff attachments provides diff content in _ascending_ alphabetical order.\r\n\r\nI believe it is better if both these views provide the diff content in the same order.

Currently, it requires some manual steps to see older changes in the \"Annotate\" view of Redmine.\r\n\r\n!{width: 634px; border: 1px solid grey;}.gitlab-view-blame-prior-to-this-change.png!\r\n"}]}}

This could by just \"2fa status\" in users grid and filter/sort possibility.\n\n-- Ticket2\n--Subject--\nPlease consider changing the way how 2FA is set up\n\n--Description--\nHey guys,\r\n\r\nI don't want to write too much, so it is not hard for you to handle this\r\nissue.\r\n\r\nRecently the ruby bug tracker has been changed to require 2FA.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem for me as I don't have a smartphone, so the change\r\nlocked me out of the bug tracker.\r\n\r\nAnyway - this is not about that; I would like to suggest a few things.\r\n\r\n(1) Right now if you click \"sign out\" you can not sign out because\r\nthe 2FA wall shows up:\r\n\r\n\"The administrator requires you to enable two-factor authentication.\"\r\n\r\nThis should be different. It should ALWAYS be possible to sign out\r\nagain. Sure I can use cookies or use another browser, but I logged\r\ninto my account of ~13 years just now. Now the 2FA wall prevents me\r\nfrom doing anything, including \"sign out\". This is not good UI.\r\n\r\nWe should be able to log out (sign out) again.\r\n\r\nAnyway this is a smaller part.\r\n\r\n(2) The bigger issue is that I don't get any information about\r\nWHY 2FA is suddenly used, and who enabled it. Yes, I get it,\r\nthe site owner did so, but perhaps the site owner was not aware\r\nthat this will effectively perma-ban some users. Not everyone\r\nhas a smartphone or can use 2FA. I already explained this\r\non rubygems.org the github issue tracker, that mandatory 2FA\r\nmeans I can no longer use rubygems, so I'd have to remove\r\nmy account at rubygems.org (whereas at github I could still\r\npublish that code, so this is weird...)\r\n\r\nPlease consider (2), because it means that the admin of a\r\nsite may accidentally retire people from ruby, without\r\neven intending to do so. To me this is a dealbreaker, \r\nbecause it means I can no longer use the official bug tracker\r\nof ruby, which then means I can no longer voice my concern\r\n(I don't use emails really ... never liked emails in ~over\r\n20 years...). That means I'd become a second class citizen\r\nto ruby, compared to other users, and since I have no intention\r\nto accept this, it would effectively mean that I would also\r\nabandon ruby in the long run.\r\n\r\nRuby is a great language, but to me mandatory 2FA is not\r\nacceptable. While this is not the fault of redmine itself,\r\nI think usability wise several things could be improved.\r\n\r\nI assume none of you guys so far thought about how this\r\ncould cause friction and strife, so hopefully the way how\r\n2FA is explained to users can change in the long run. I\r\nhad slowly collect that information since nothing\r\nwas announced anywhere! Suddenly from one day to the\r\nother I was slapped into the face with that 2FA wall,\r\nso perhaps you can understand my frustration here."}]}}

Tracker A that are assigned to Paul and Tracker B that are assigned to John. You need to see both of these side-by-side to be able to compare the due dates between the two and take action as needed.\r\nYou define your first \"query\"/filter by filtering for Tracker: \"A\" and Assigned to: \"Paul\". After that, you click a \"+\" icon below the filter/options that adds another set of filter/options and you can define your second \"query\"/filter by setting Tracker: \"B\" and Assigned to: \"John\". Click apply and it will run both queries, distinct & union the result set and display accordingly. The displayed columns would be shared between all issues.\r\n\r\nThis could also lead into some sort of combined custom query searching capability if that is something you guys want to explore.\r\n\r\n----"}]}}

Usage\r\n\r\nThe attached patch extends the import configuration view with a new block, so that users may select a column for each relation type. The parent issue field also moved to the new block, since it's conceptually related.\r\n\r\nWithin the CSV file the columns may define multiple relations of the same type, each separated with @,@. Related issues follow the same rules as parent issues. A string preceded with a @#@ is supposed to be an existing issue. Without the @#@ it's supposed to be another row within the import file. For _follows_ and _precedes_ relations an additional delay may be present, e.g. @#12 3d@ specifying a relation to issue @#12@ and a delay of 3 days.\r\n\r\nh3. Technical notes\r\n\r\nSince issue relations may only be created when the issue was already saved, I've added a second step to the import. Additionally to @build_object@, which needs to be implemented by @Import@ sub classes, there's also a @extend_object@ method now. This is used by the @IssueImporter@ to save the relations after the issue was already saved successfully.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Additional considerations\r\n\r\nInitially, I wanted to build the import, so that issue relations exported from Redmine could be imported directly. But the format that's used by the exporter was designed for humans, not so much for computers. Most importantly, to parse this format we would need to grep for the localized relation names, which might even change between versions of Redmine. Therefore I settled for the proposed approach of having separate columns for each relation type."}]}}

Preface\r\n\r\nThe imports controller was obviously built to be used for more than just issue imports. But since Redmine currently only supports issue imports, there are now some places, where assumptions about the issue import are hard-coded.\r\n\r\nThere are some plugins out there, which add other kinds of CSV imports to Redmine, but none of them seems to use the imports controller. I assume, it's because of the shortcomings mentioned above. I wanted to improve this situation, so I decided to build a time entry importer and - along the way - generalize the imports controller so that it's able to handle more than just issues.\r\n\r\nh3. Preparations\r\n\r\nThe first patch attached extracts the issue related view parts into partials which are determined by convention. They are all prefixed with the imported model name, i.e. @_issues@. \r\n\r\nThe issue related model parts are moved to the import model. Those are, e.g. the proper menu item, the authorization or the layout. Strictly speaking they should be located on the controller level, but I did not want to build sub classes of the imports controller for each and every kind of import.\r\n\r\nh3. Adding the time entry import\r\n\r\nThe second patch attached adds the time entry import. It's using the newly introduced extension points to fill in the blanks. To provide a way for the user to find the new import, I've added the @timelog/_sidebar@ partial, similar to the one for issues. This new sidebar partial is now used in the timelog views and it contains a link to the import.\r\n\r\n*Note:* within said partial, I've mis/re-used an i18n key @label_time_entries_visibility_all@ since it was providing the desired text in German and English. I did not want to introduce a new key based on the existing one, since that would have probably caused major merge problems. If desired, I may of course do that anyway.\r\n\r\nh3. Closing notes\r\n\r\nThe second patch may of course also become a plugin. The main point of this patch (series) was it, to allow plugins to reuse the existing plugin infrastructure. Without the first patch though, a plugin author would need copy most of the views and functionality of the imports class, which is undesirable (at least for the plugin author).\r\n\r\nThank you for considering these patches."}]}}

Usage\r\n\r\nThe attached patch extends the import configuration view with a new block, so that users may select a column for each relation type. The parent issue field also moved to the new block, since it's conceptually related.\r\n\r\nWithin the CSV file the columns may define multiple relations of the same type, each separated with @,@. Related issues follow the same rules as parent issues. A string preceded with a @#@ is supposed to be an existing issue. Without the @#@ it's supposed to be another row within the import file. For _follows_ and _precedes_ relations an additional delay may be present, e.g. @#12 3d@ specifying a relation to issue @#12@ and a delay of 3 days.\r\n\r\nh3. Technical notes\r\n\r\nSince issue relations may only be created when the issue was already saved, I've added a second step to the import. Additionally to @build_object@, which needs to be implemented by @Import@ sub classes, there's also a @extend_object@ method now. This is used by the @IssueImporter@ to save the relations after the issue was already saved successfully.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Additional considerations\r\n\r\nInitially, I wanted to build the import, so that issue relations exported from Redmine could be imported directly. But the format that's used by the exporter was designed for humans, not so much for computers. Most importantly, to parse this format we would need to grep for the localized relation names, which might even change between versions of Redmine. Therefore I settled for the proposed approach of having separate columns for each relation type."}]}}

Preface\r\n\r\nThe imports controller was obviously built to be used for more than just issue imports. But since Redmine currently only supports issue imports, there are now some places, where assumptions about the issue import are hard-coded.\r\n\r\nThere are some plugins out there, which add other kinds of CSV imports to Redmine, but none of them seems to use the imports controller. I assume, it's because of the shortcomings mentioned above. I wanted to improve this situation, so I decided to build a time entry importer and - along the way - generalize the imports controller so that it's able to handle more than just issues.\r\n\r\nh3. Preparations\r\n\r\nThe first patch attached extracts the issue related view parts into partials which are determined by convention. They are all prefixed with the imported model name, i.e. @_issues@. \r\n\r\nThe issue related model parts are moved to the import model. Those are, e.g. the proper menu item, the authorization or the layout. Strictly speaking they should be located on the controller level, but I did not want to build sub classes of the imports controller for each and every kind of import.\r\n\r\nh3. Adding the time entry import\r\n\r\nThe second patch attached adds the time entry import. It's using the newly introduced extension points to fill in the blanks. To provide a way for the user to find the new import, I've added the @timelog/_sidebar@ partial, similar to the one for issues. This new sidebar partial is now used in the timelog views and it contains a link to the import.\r\n\r\n*Note:* within said partial, I've mis/re-used an i18n key @label_time_entries_visibility_all@ since it was providing the desired text in German and English. I did not want to introduce a new key based on the existing one, since that would have probably caused major merge problems. If desired, I may of course do that anyway.\r\n\r\nh3. Closing notes\r\n\r\nThe second patch may of course also become a plugin. The main point of this patch (series) was it, to allow plugins to reuse the existing plugin infrastructure. Without the first patch though, a plugin author would need copy most of the views and functionality of the imports class, which is undesirable (at least for the plugin author).\r\n\r\nThank you for considering these patches."}]}}

They could e.g. lack both a priority and a subject altogether or lack a priority and substitute the subject attribute with a title or name attribute in the form of a custom field.\r\n\r\nI think it would be great if Redmine could support such configurations without the need for users/admins to resort to (custom) workarounds.

This cannot be done with the same ease to e.g. rename the subject attribute to a title attribute as issues of other trackers (e.g. an old-school defect tracker) use the same attribute OOTB, hence the request to also make the subject attribute disablable."}]}}

Specifically, we are sending one mail per recipient user. Each of those mails is rendered in the context of the recipient (i.e. with @User.current@ set to the recipient). The mails can be sent immediately or optionally delayed using ActiveJob.\r\n\r\nThis approach has a couple of advantages over the existing approach of sending a single mail to multiple recipients:\r\n\r\n* We ensure object visibility for the rendered mails in the most generic way. Since each mail is rendered with @User.current@ set to the recipient, all content rendered in the mail (including shown issue attributes, macros and links in rendered textile text, ...) is guaranteed to only be visible to the user without having to ensure this manually for each mail using the same visibility rules as used for the HTML views already.\r\n* The mail will always be sent in the recipients language, even if multiple users with different languages are notified\r\n* There is no risk of the whole notification mail being rejected because of a single invalid recipient address (see #8157, #6829, #8733 and a lot of duplicates)\r\n\r\nIn the long run, it will also allow us to introduce user-specific additional information in the rendered notification, e.g. related issues, links to assign the issue, ...\r\n\r\nWith this new approach, we do have a some challenges which we are trying to address separately:\r\n\r\n* Since each mail is always rendered with an adapted @User.current@, any mail views which expected to use the original @User.current@ need to be adapted. In Redmine core, this only affects the security notifications.\r\n* Depending on the number of recipients for a notification, there might be many rendered mails which can take some time in the request. To ensure a snappy response, we can use ActiveJob to render and send the mails in the background. This can make the @async_*@ delivery methods obsolete.\r\n\r\nh2. Reminder: How mail sending works in plain Rails (and Redmine)\r\n\r\nThis patch series changes how mails are generated and delivered. Let's first look at how a mail normally gets generated and delivered in ActionMailer.\r\n\r\n* @mail = Mailer.news_added(news)@ - The user calls a class-method of the Mailer class (a child-class of ActionMailer::Base). This method is usually not implemented in the @Mailer@ class itself. Instead, there is a \"@method_missing@\":https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v5.1.2/actionmailer/lib/action_mailer/base.rb#L576-L582 method on @ActionMailer::Base@. Here, ActionMailer creates a @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object. Which is basically a delegator to an _eventually rendered_ mail object. Now, the mail is not actually rendered here. The @MessageDelivery@ object only collects all arguments it needs to eventually render the mail. This happens implicitly when any method on the mail is accessed (e.g. when the mail is about to be delivered). The @MessageDelivery@ delegator is returned to the user.\r\n\r\nNow that we have the (delegated) mail, we can deliver it with @mail.deliver@. This method used to be the only delivery method. With newer Rails versions, there is (with some variations) @deliver_now@ and @deliver_later@. Redmine usually calls @deliver@ which in source:trunk/config/initializers/10-patches.rb#L160 calls @deliver_now@ currently.\r\n\r\nWhen calling @mail.deliver@, the delegator starts to render the mail:\r\n\r\n* \"@MessageDelivery#processed_mailer@\":https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v5.1.3/actionmailer/lib/action_mailer/message_delivery.rb#L103-L107 creates a new @Mailer@ instance and calls @process@ on it.\r\n* @Mailer#process(:news_added, news)@ - The @process@ method is part of ActionMailer (and in turn part of the @ActionController@ framework on which ActionMailer is based on). Among things, it calls the specified action, i.e. the instance method.\r\n* @Mailer#news_added(news)@ - This instance method is implemented on the Mailer class and is responsible to render the actual mail message. Here, we set headers, instance variables for the view and basically do the usual controller stuff. With a final call to @mail@, we eventually render a single mail and return a @Mail::Message@ object.\r\n* This returned @Mail::Message@ object is delivered with a call to @Mail::Message#deliver_now@.\r\n\r\nh2. How we hook into this process\r\n\r\nNow, in order to send multiple mails, we hook into this process to render (and deliver) multiple mails. We want to ensure two things:\r\n\r\n* We want to create multiple mails, one per recipient and deliver them all in one go.\r\n* When rendering the mail (i.e. when calling the Mailer's instance method), we want to set @User.current@ to the recipient user and set it back to the original value after the rendering is done\r\n\r\nThese two goals are achieved with two specific changes to our Mailer:\r\n\r\nWe introduce a wrapper class called @Mailer::MultiMessage@. Instances of this class wrap multiple @Mail::Message@ objects (or rather @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ objects which delegate to @Mail::Message@ objects). The class provides the same @deliver_*@ methods as the original @Mail::Message@ objects. When calling such a method, we are calling it on each of the wrapped messages. This allows us to use an instance of this class in place of a @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object.\r\n\r\nWe use this class by implementing _class methods_ for each mailer action. These class methods implement the same external interface (i.e. accept the same arguments) as the old instance methods. This ensures that we keep the existing public interface. The class methods fetch the recipient users for the respective object (i.e. the issue, news, comment, ...). We use @Mailer::MultiMessage#for@ to add an @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object for each recipient which eventually renders the mail.\r\n\r\nWhen creating the delegator, we also pass the recipient user to the arguments for the mail rendering. We use this user in the overwritten @Mailer#process@ method to set @User.current@ and their language before actually rendering the message. This convention allows us to keep the interfaces clear: the user is only passed between the class method and @Mailer#process@ but doesn't need to be specified on the instance action. Here, it is already set as @User.current@ for each rendered mail.\r\n\r\nWe also extend @Mailer.method_missing@ (on the class) to create a single-mail @Mailer::MultiMessage@ object with the current user in case the class method for an action is not explicitly overwritten. This ensures that our convention of always passing a user to @Mailer#process@ is kept up even if a plugin only adds an instance method (which was valid before).\r\n\r\nh2. What we tried and did not work\r\n\r\nI first attempted to set the current user directly in the action's class method. and reset it directly afterwards. That would have made the code much more localized. However, due to the delayed rendering of the mail with the @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object, the mail will be rendered only after we have already reset the current user.\r\n\r\nOne way to work around this would be to introduce @deliver_*@ methods (like the now obsolete @Mailer.deliver_issue_add@ method). However doing so would have changed the intended external interface of our @Mailer@ class and would likely lead to integration pain with all existing Redmine plugins sending mail.\r\n\r\nh2. What we ship\r\n\r\nWe ship three patches here:\r\n\r\n* @0001-Send-individual-emails-for-each-mail-recipient.patch@ - The main implementation including tests.\r\n* @0002-Cleanup-Remove-Issue-each_notification-and-Journal-e.patch@ - Removes unneccessary methods for grouping recipients based on custom field visibility\r\n* @0003-Optional-Ensure-that-ActiveRecord-Base-objects-are-f.patch@ - An optional patch which changes the serialization behavior when sending mails with ActiveJob (e.g. with @Mailer.news_added(news).deliver_later@). By default, Rails serialized the arguments as a globalid (which is basically a reference to the object in the database identified by its ID). If there are concurrent changes to e.g. a newly created issue, this might result in notifications using the new state instead of the original state. With this patch, we serialize the exact attributes of the given objects into the job. Since this also causes nested attributes to be serialized along, care must be taken to avoid reference errors. In general, we should probably try to use mostly immutable state in the database where it is an important consideration that the notification state is exactly shown in the DB.\r\n\r\nh2. Future work\r\n\r\nh3. ActiveJob sending\r\n\r\nIf the general direction of this patch is accepted, it is probably desireable to move the mail sending to ActiveJob completely. This could replace the @async_*@ delivery methods [[EmailConfiguration#Asynchronous-delivery_methods|currently configurable]] in @configuration.yml@. This change can either be hardcoded in source:trunk/config/initializers/10-patches.rb#L160 or made configurable with a setting. I'll be glad to provide a patch for this. It would only be a few lines of code.\r\n\r\nBy default, we could use the in-process ActiveJob runner to send mails. More advanced users with a dedicated job worker (e.g. delayed job) can easily switch to that without changes to the Redmine code itself.\r\n\r\nh3. BCC recipients\r\n\r\nSince each user gets their own mail, we can probably remove the setting to send mails with BCC completely. If plugins want to send mails to non-user recipients, we would have to make sure to either set the recipients manually on BCC or group them appropriately. It is not a required setting in Redmine core anymore though."}]}}

Proposal\r\n\r\nIn Redmine4.0, other destinations are no longer displayed in the notification email.\r\n\r\nThis is a side effect of the following changes in Redmine 4.0.\r\nhttps://redmine.org/issues/26791\r\n\r\nDepending on the contents of the ticket, it may be necessary to confirm who is notified.\r\nFor example, the response may change depending on whether the trouble ticket content is delivered to the CEO.\r\n\r\nIn Redmine3.4, it was found from the To / Cc column of the notification email that the email was sent to someone else.\r\nIn Redmine 4.0 or later, you can not understand without checking the ticket.\r\n\r\nAlso, the amount sent to the person who has been set to \"notify all\" in the personal settings cannot be confirmed on the ticket.\r\n\r\nh1. Solution\r\n\r\nThere is no problem in sending individual emails.\r\nThe only inconvenience is that you can no longer check the simultaneous notification destination directly from the email.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the conventional To / Cc (watch) can be added to the beginning of the email text by setting the individual ID unit.\r\n\r\nh1. Supplement\r\n\r\nIn Redmine3.X, there was a side effect that other destinations could be known by batch mailing. (Specification changed in 4.0)\r\nIt seems that it was not recognized that there were cases where this was used as a substantial function.\r\n(In some cases, it may be necessary to respond depending on the email notification destination)\r\n\r\nYou can tell by checking the ticket from the link on the notification email, but it will be a burden if there are many cases.\r\n\r\n/* The following is a Japanese supplement */\r\n\r\nRedmine\u306e\u901a\u77e5\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u3001\u4ed6\u306e\u5b9b\u5148\u3092\u8868\u793a\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3059\u308b\r\n\r\n\u25a0\u63d0\u6848\u5185\u5bb9\r\n\r\nRedmine4.0\u306b\u3066\u3001\u901a\u77e5\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u4ed6\u306e\u5b9b\u5148\u304c\u8868\u793a\u3055\u308c\u306a\u304f\u306a\u3063\u305f\u3002\r\n\r\n\u3053\u308c\u306fRedmine4.0\u306e\u4e0b\u8a18\u5909\u66f4\u306b\u3088\u308b\u526f\u4f5c\u7528\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3002\r\nhttps://redmine.org/issues/26791\r\n\r\n\u30c1\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u5185\u5bb9\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u306f\u3001\u4ed6\u306e\u8ab0\u306b\u901a\u77e5\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304b\u78ba\u8a8d\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u5834\u5408\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3002\r\n\u4f8b\u3048\u3070\u3001\u30c8\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u306e\u30c1\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u5185\u5bb9\u304cCEO\u306b\u914d\u4fe1\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304b\u3069\u3046\u304b\u3067\u3001\u5bfe\u5fdc\u304c\u5909\u308f\u308b\u5834\u5408\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3002\r\n\r\nRedmine3.4\u306e\u6642\u306f\u3001\u901a\u77e5\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb\u306eTo/Cc\u6b04\u304b\u3089\u3001\u4ed6\u306e\u8ab0\u306b\u9001\u4fe1\u3055\u308c\u305f\u304b\u5224\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001\r\nRedmine4.0\u4ee5\u964d\u3067\u306f\u30c1\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u78ba\u8a8d\u3057\u306a\u3044\u3068\u5224\u3089\u306a\u3044\u3002\r\n\r\n\u307e\u305f\u3001\u500b\u4eba\u8a2d\u5b9a\u3067\u300c\u3059\u3079\u3066\u901a\u77e5\u300d\u306b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u4eba\u3078\u306e\u9001\u4fe1\u5206\u306f\u3001\u30c1\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u4e0a\u304b\u3089\u78ba\u8a8d\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u3002\r\n\r\n\u25a0\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56\r\n\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u500b\u5225\u9001\u4fe1\u81ea\u4f53\u306b\u306f\u554f\u984c\u306a\u3044\u3002\r\n\u540c\u6642\u901a\u77e5\u5148\u3092\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb\u304b\u3089\u76f4\u63a5\u78ba\u8a8d\u3067\u304d\u306a\u304f\u306a\u3063\u305f\u306e\u304c\u4e0d\u4fbf\u306a\u3060\u3051\u3002\r\n\r\n\u500b\u4ebaID\u5358\u4f4d\u306e\u8a2d\u5b9a\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u5f93\u6765\u306eTo/Cc(watch) \u3092\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb\u30c6\u30ad\u30b9\u30c8\u5148\u982d\u306b\u4ed8\u3051\u3089\u308c\u308c\u3070\u826f\u3044\u3068\u601d\u308f\u308c\u308b\u3002\r\n\r\n\u25a0\u88dc\u8db3\r\nRedmine3.X\u3067\u306f\u3001\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb\u4e00\u62ec\u9001\u4fe1\u306b\u3088\u308a\u4ed6\u306e\u9001\u4fe1\u5148\u304c\u5224\u308b\u3068\u3044\u3046\u526f\u4f5c\u7528\u304c\u3042\u3063\u305f\u3002\uff084.0\u3067\u4ed5\u69d8\u5909\u66f4\uff09\r\n\u3053\u308c\u3092\u5b9f\u8cea\u7684\u306a\u6a5f\u80fd\u3068\u3057\u3066\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u5834\u5408\u304c\u3042\u3063\u305f\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3001\u8a8d\u8b58\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3068\u601d\u308f\u308c\u308b\u3002\r\n\uff08\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb\u901a\u77e5\u5148\u306b\u3088\u308a\u5bfe\u5fdc\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u3082\u3042\u308b\uff09\r\n\r\n\u901a\u77e5\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb\u4e0a\u306e\u30ea\u30f3\u30af\u304b\u3089\u30c1\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u78ba\u8a8d\u3059\u308c\u3070\u5224\u308b\u304c\u3001\u4ef6\u6570\u304c\u591a\u3051\u308c\u3070\u8ca0\u62c5\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3002\r\n\r\n\u672c\u30c1\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u5bfe\u5fdc\u306f\u4e0b\u8a18\u306b\u8a18\u8f09\u3057\u307e\u3059\r\nhttps://redmine.tokyo/issues/1083\r\n"}]}}

Usage\r\n\r\nThe attached patch extends the import configuration view with a new block, so that users may select a column for each relation type. The parent issue field also moved to the new block, since it's conceptually related.\r\n\r\nWithin the CSV file the columns may define multiple relations of the same type, each separated with @,@. Related issues follow the same rules as parent issues. A string preceded with a @#@ is supposed to be an existing issue. Without the @#@ it's supposed to be another row within the import file. For _follows_ and _precedes_ relations an additional delay may be present, e.g. @#12 3d@ specifying a relation to issue @#12@ and a delay of 3 days.\r\n\r\nh3. Technical notes\r\n\r\nSince issue relations may only be created when the issue was already saved, I've added a second step to the import. Additionally to @build_object@, which needs to be implemented by @Import@ sub classes, there's also a @extend_object@ method now. This is used by the @IssueImporter@ to save the relations after the issue was already saved successfully.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Additional considerations\r\n\r\nInitially, I wanted to build the import, so that issue relations exported from Redmine could be imported directly. But the format that's used by the exporter was designed for humans, not so much for computers. Most importantly, to parse this format we would need to grep for the localized relation names, which might even change between versions of Redmine. Therefore I settled for the proposed approach of having separate columns for each relation type."}]}}

Specifically, we are sending one mail per recipient user. Each of those mails is rendered in the context of the recipient (i.e. with @User.current@ set to the recipient). The mails can be sent immediately or optionally delayed using ActiveJob.\r\n\r\nThis approach has a couple of advantages over the existing approach of sending a single mail to multiple recipients:\r\n\r\n* We ensure object visibility for the rendered mails in the most generic way. Since each mail is rendered with @User.current@ set to the recipient, all content rendered in the mail (including shown issue attributes, macros and links in rendered textile text, ...) is guaranteed to only be visible to the user without having to ensure this manually for each mail using the same visibility rules as used for the HTML views already.\r\n* The mail will always be sent in the recipients language, even if multiple users with different languages are notified\r\n* There is no risk of the whole notification mail being rejected because of a single invalid recipient address (see #8157, #6829, #8733 and a lot of duplicates)\r\n\r\nIn the long run, it will also allow us to introduce user-specific additional information in the rendered notification, e.g. related issues, links to assign the issue, ...\r\n\r\nWith this new approach, we do have a some challenges which we are trying to address separately:\r\n\r\n* Since each mail is always rendered with an adapted @User.current@, any mail views which expected to use the original @User.current@ need to be adapted. In Redmine core, this only affects the security notifications.\r\n* Depending on the number of recipients for a notification, there might be many rendered mails which can take some time in the request. To ensure a snappy response, we can use ActiveJob to render and send the mails in the background. This can make the @async_*@ delivery methods obsolete.\r\n\r\nh2. Reminder: How mail sending works in plain Rails (and Redmine)\r\n\r\nThis patch series changes how mails are generated and delivered. Let's first look at how a mail normally gets generated and delivered in ActionMailer.\r\n\r\n* @mail = Mailer.news_added(news)@ - The user calls a class-method of the Mailer class (a child-class of ActionMailer::Base). This method is usually not implemented in the @Mailer@ class itself. Instead, there is a \"@method_missing@\":https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v5.1.2/actionmailer/lib/action_mailer/base.rb#L576-L582 method on @ActionMailer::Base@. Here, ActionMailer creates a @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object. Which is basically a delegator to an _eventually rendered_ mail object. Now, the mail is not actually rendered here. The @MessageDelivery@ object only collects all arguments it needs to eventually render the mail. This happens implicitly when any method on the mail is accessed (e.g. when the mail is about to be delivered). The @MessageDelivery@ delegator is returned to the user.\r\n\r\nNow that we have the (delegated) mail, we can deliver it with @mail.deliver@. This method used to be the only delivery method. With newer Rails versions, there is (with some variations) @deliver_now@ and @deliver_later@. Redmine usually calls @deliver@ which in source:trunk/config/initializers/10-patches.rb#L160 calls @deliver_now@ currently.\r\n\r\nWhen calling @mail.deliver@, the delegator starts to render the mail:\r\n\r\n* \"@MessageDelivery#processed_mailer@\":https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v5.1.3/actionmailer/lib/action_mailer/message_delivery.rb#L103-L107 creates a new @Mailer@ instance and calls @process@ on it.\r\n* @Mailer#process(:news_added, news)@ - The @process@ method is part of ActionMailer (and in turn part of the @ActionController@ framework on which ActionMailer is based on). Among things, it calls the specified action, i.e. the instance method.\r\n* @Mailer#news_added(news)@ - This instance method is implemented on the Mailer class and is responsible to render the actual mail message. Here, we set headers, instance variables for the view and basically do the usual controller stuff. With a final call to @mail@, we eventually render a single mail and return a @Mail::Message@ object.\r\n* This returned @Mail::Message@ object is delivered with a call to @Mail::Message#deliver_now@.\r\n\r\nh2. How we hook into this process\r\n\r\nNow, in order to send multiple mails, we hook into this process to render (and deliver) multiple mails. We want to ensure two things:\r\n\r\n* We want to create multiple mails, one per recipient and deliver them all in one go.\r\n* When rendering the mail (i.e. when calling the Mailer's instance method), we want to set @User.current@ to the recipient user and set it back to the original value after the rendering is done\r\n\r\nThese two goals are achieved with two specific changes to our Mailer:\r\n\r\nWe introduce a wrapper class called @Mailer::MultiMessage@. Instances of this class wrap multiple @Mail::Message@ objects (or rather @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ objects which delegate to @Mail::Message@ objects). The class provides the same @deliver_*@ methods as the original @Mail::Message@ objects. When calling such a method, we are calling it on each of the wrapped messages. This allows us to use an instance of this class in place of a @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object.\r\n\r\nWe use this class by implementing _class methods_ for each mailer action. These class methods implement the same external interface (i.e. accept the same arguments) as the old instance methods. This ensures that we keep the existing public interface. The class methods fetch the recipient users for the respective object (i.e. the issue, news, comment, ...). We use @Mailer::MultiMessage#for@ to add an @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object for each recipient which eventually renders the mail.\r\n\r\nWhen creating the delegator, we also pass the recipient user to the arguments for the mail rendering. We use this user in the overwritten @Mailer#process@ method to set @User.current@ and their language before actually rendering the message. This convention allows us to keep the interfaces clear: the user is only passed between the class method and @Mailer#process@ but doesn't need to be specified on the instance action. Here, it is already set as @User.current@ for each rendered mail.\r\n\r\nWe also extend @Mailer.method_missing@ (on the class) to create a single-mail @Mailer::MultiMessage@ object with the current user in case the class method for an action is not explicitly overwritten. This ensures that our convention of always passing a user to @Mailer#process@ is kept up even if a plugin only adds an instance method (which was valid before).\r\n\r\nh2. What we tried and did not work\r\n\r\nI first attempted to set the current user directly in the action's class method. and reset it directly afterwards. That would have made the code much more localized. However, due to the delayed rendering of the mail with the @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object, the mail will be rendered only after we have already reset the current user.\r\n\r\nOne way to work around this would be to introduce @deliver_*@ methods (like the now obsolete @Mailer.deliver_issue_add@ method). However doing so would have changed the intended external interface of our @Mailer@ class and would likely lead to integration pain with all existing Redmine plugins sending mail.\r\n\r\nh2. What we ship\r\n\r\nWe ship three patches here:\r\n\r\n* @0001-Send-individual-emails-for-each-mail-recipient.patch@ - The main implementation including tests.\r\n* @0002-Cleanup-Remove-Issue-each_notification-and-Journal-e.patch@ - Removes unneccessary methods for grouping recipients based on custom field visibility\r\n* @0003-Optional-Ensure-that-ActiveRecord-Base-objects-are-f.patch@ - An optional patch which changes the serialization behavior when sending mails with ActiveJob (e.g. with @Mailer.news_added(news).deliver_later@). By default, Rails serialized the arguments as a globalid (which is basically a reference to the object in the database identified by its ID). If there are concurrent changes to e.g. a newly created issue, this might result in notifications using the new state instead of the original state. With this patch, we serialize the exact attributes of the given objects into the job. Since this also causes nested attributes to be serialized along, care must be taken to avoid reference errors. In general, we should probably try to use mostly immutable state in the database where it is an important consideration that the notification state is exactly shown in the DB.\r\n\r\nh2. Future work\r\n\r\nh3. ActiveJob sending\r\n\r\nIf the general direction of this patch is accepted, it is probably desireable to move the mail sending to ActiveJob completely. This could replace the @async_*@ delivery methods [[EmailConfiguration#Asynchronous-delivery_methods|currently configurable]] in @configuration.yml@. This change can either be hardcoded in source:trunk/config/initializers/10-patches.rb#L160 or made configurable with a setting. I'll be glad to provide a patch for this. It would only be a few lines of code.\r\n\r\nBy default, we could use the in-process ActiveJob runner to send mails. More advanced users with a dedicated job worker (e.g. delayed job) can easily switch to that without changes to the Redmine code itself.\r\n\r\nh3. BCC recipients\r\n\r\nSince each user gets their own mail, we can probably remove the setting to send mails with BCC completely. If plugins want to send mails to non-user recipients, we would have to make sure to either set the recipients manually on BCC or group them appropriately. It is not a required setting in Redmine core anymore though."}]}}

Specifically, we are sending one mail per recipient user. Each of those mails is rendered in the context of the recipient (i.e. with @User.current@ set to the recipient). The mails can be sent immediately or optionally delayed using ActiveJob.\r\n\r\nThis approach has a couple of advantages over the existing approach of sending a single mail to multiple recipients:\r\n\r\n* We ensure object visibility for the rendered mails in the most generic way. Since each mail is rendered with @User.current@ set to the recipient, all content rendered in the mail (including shown issue attributes, macros and links in rendered textile text, ...) is guaranteed to only be visible to the user without having to ensure this manually for each mail using the same visibility rules as used for the HTML views already.\r\n* The mail will always be sent in the recipients language, even if multiple users with different languages are notified\r\n* There is no risk of the whole notification mail being rejected because of a single invalid recipient address (see #8157, #6829, #8733 and a lot of duplicates)\r\n\r\nIn the long run, it will also allow us to introduce user-specific additional information in the rendered notification, e.g. related issues, links to assign the issue, ...\r\n\r\nWith this new approach, we do have a some challenges which we are trying to address separately:\r\n\r\n* Since each mail is always rendered with an adapted @User.current@, any mail views which expected to use the original @User.current@ need to be adapted. In Redmine core, this only affects the security notifications.\r\n* Depending on the number of recipients for a notification, there might be many rendered mails which can take some time in the request. To ensure a snappy response, we can use ActiveJob to render and send the mails in the background. This can make the @async_*@ delivery methods obsolete.\r\n\r\nh2. Reminder: How mail sending works in plain Rails (and Redmine)\r\n\r\nThis patch series changes how mails are generated and delivered. Let's first look at how a mail normally gets generated and delivered in ActionMailer.\r\n\r\n* @mail = Mailer.news_added(news)@ - The user calls a class-method of the Mailer class (a child-class of ActionMailer::Base). This method is usually not implemented in the @Mailer@ class itself. Instead, there is a \"@method_missing@\":https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v5.1.2/actionmailer/lib/action_mailer/base.rb#L576-L582 method on @ActionMailer::Base@. Here, ActionMailer creates a @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object. Which is basically a delegator to an _eventually rendered_ mail object. Now, the mail is not actually rendered here. The @MessageDelivery@ object only collects all arguments it needs to eventually render the mail. This happens implicitly when any method on the mail is accessed (e.g. when the mail is about to be delivered). The @MessageDelivery@ delegator is returned to the user.\r\n\r\nNow that we have the (delegated) mail, we can deliver it with @mail.deliver@. This method used to be the only delivery method. With newer Rails versions, there is (with some variations) @deliver_now@ and @deliver_later@. Redmine usually calls @deliver@ which in source:trunk/config/initializers/10-patches.rb#L160 calls @deliver_now@ currently.\r\n\r\nWhen calling @mail.deliver@, the delegator starts to render the mail:\r\n\r\n* \"@MessageDelivery#processed_mailer@\":https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v5.1.3/actionmailer/lib/action_mailer/message_delivery.rb#L103-L107 creates a new @Mailer@ instance and calls @process@ on it.\r\n* @Mailer#process(:news_added, news)@ - The @process@ method is part of ActionMailer (and in turn part of the @ActionController@ framework on which ActionMailer is based on). Among things, it calls the specified action, i.e. the instance method.\r\n* @Mailer#news_added(news)@ - This instance method is implemented on the Mailer class and is responsible to render the actual mail message. Here, we set headers, instance variables for the view and basically do the usual controller stuff. With a final call to @mail@, we eventually render a single mail and return a @Mail::Message@ object.\r\n* This returned @Mail::Message@ object is delivered with a call to @Mail::Message#deliver_now@.\r\n\r\nh2. How we hook into this process\r\n\r\nNow, in order to send multiple mails, we hook into this process to render (and deliver) multiple mails. We want to ensure two things:\r\n\r\n* We want to create multiple mails, one per recipient and deliver them all in one go.\r\n* When rendering the mail (i.e. when calling the Mailer's instance method), we want to set @User.current@ to the recipient user and set it back to the original value after the rendering is done\r\n\r\nThese two goals are achieved with two specific changes to our Mailer:\r\n\r\nWe introduce a wrapper class called @Mailer::MultiMessage@. Instances of this class wrap multiple @Mail::Message@ objects (or rather @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ objects which delegate to @Mail::Message@ objects). The class provides the same @deliver_*@ methods as the original @Mail::Message@ objects. When calling such a method, we are calling it on each of the wrapped messages. This allows us to use an instance of this class in place of a @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object.\r\n\r\nWe use this class by implementing _class methods_ for each mailer action. These class methods implement the same external interface (i.e. accept the same arguments) as the old instance methods. This ensures that we keep the existing public interface. The class methods fetch the recipient users for the respective object (i.e. the issue, news, comment, ...). We use @Mailer::MultiMessage#for@ to add an @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object for each recipient which eventually renders the mail.\r\n\r\nWhen creating the delegator, we also pass the recipient user to the arguments for the mail rendering. We use this user in the overwritten @Mailer#process@ method to set @User.current@ and their language before actually rendering the message. This convention allows us to keep the interfaces clear: the user is only passed between the class method and @Mailer#process@ but doesn't need to be specified on the instance action. Here, it is already set as @User.current@ for each rendered mail.\r\n\r\nWe also extend @Mailer.method_missing@ (on the class) to create a single-mail @Mailer::MultiMessage@ object with the current user in case the class method for an action is not explicitly overwritten. This ensures that our convention of always passing a user to @Mailer#process@ is kept up even if a plugin only adds an instance method (which was valid before).\r\n\r\nh2. What we tried and did not work\r\n\r\nI first attempted to set the current user directly in the action's class method. and reset it directly afterwards. That would have made the code much more localized. However, due to the delayed rendering of the mail with the @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object, the mail will be rendered only after we have already reset the current user.\r\n\r\nOne way to work around this would be to introduce @deliver_*@ methods (like the now obsolete @Mailer.deliver_issue_add@ method). However doing so would have changed the intended external interface of our @Mailer@ class and would likely lead to integration pain with all existing Redmine plugins sending mail.\r\n\r\nh2. What we ship\r\n\r\nWe ship three patches here:\r\n\r\n* @0001-Send-individual-emails-for-each-mail-recipient.patch@ - The main implementation including tests.\r\n* @0002-Cleanup-Remove-Issue-each_notification-and-Journal-e.patch@ - Removes unneccessary methods for grouping recipients based on custom field visibility\r\n* @0003-Optional-Ensure-that-ActiveRecord-Base-objects-are-f.patch@ - An optional patch which changes the serialization behavior when sending mails with ActiveJob (e.g. with @Mailer.news_added(news).deliver_later@). By default, Rails serialized the arguments as a globalid (which is basically a reference to the object in the database identified by its ID). If there are concurrent changes to e.g. a newly created issue, this might result in notifications using the new state instead of the original state. With this patch, we serialize the exact attributes of the given objects into the job. Since this also causes nested attributes to be serialized along, care must be taken to avoid reference errors. In general, we should probably try to use mostly immutable state in the database where it is an important consideration that the notification state is exactly shown in the DB.\r\n\r\nh2. Future work\r\n\r\nh3. ActiveJob sending\r\n\r\nIf the general direction of this patch is accepted, it is probably desireable to move the mail sending to ActiveJob completely. This could replace the @async_*@ delivery methods [[EmailConfiguration#Asynchronous-delivery_methods|currently configurable]] in @configuration.yml@. This change can either be hardcoded in source:trunk/config/initializers/10-patches.rb#L160 or made configurable with a setting. I'll be glad to provide a patch for this. It would only be a few lines of code.\r\n\r\nBy default, we could use the in-process ActiveJob runner to send mails. More advanced users with a dedicated job worker (e.g. delayed job) can easily switch to that without changes to the Redmine code itself.\r\n\r\nh3. BCC recipients\r\n\r\nSince each user gets their own mail, we can probably remove the setting to send mails with BCC completely. If plugins want to send mails to non-user recipients, we would have to make sure to either set the recipients manually on BCC or group them appropriately. It is not a required setting in Redmine core anymore though."}]}}

Proposal\r\n\r\nIn Redmine4.0, other destinations are no longer displayed in the notification email.\r\n\r\nThis is a side effect of the following changes in Redmine 4.0.\r\nhttps://redmine.org/issues/26791\r\n\r\nDepending on the contents of the ticket, it may be necessary to confirm who is notified.\r\nFor example, the response may change depending on whether the trouble ticket content is delivered to the CEO.\r\n\r\nIn Redmine3.4, it was found from the To / Cc column of the notification email that the email was sent to someone else.\r\nIn Redmine 4.0 or later, you can not understand without checking the ticket.\r\n\r\nAlso, the amount sent to the person who has been set to \"notify all\" in the personal settings cannot be confirmed on the ticket.\r\n\r\nh1. Solution\r\n\r\nThere is no problem in sending individual emails.\r\nThe only inconvenience is that you can no longer check the simultaneous notification destination directly from the email.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the conventional To / Cc (watch) can be added to the beginning of the email text by setting the individual ID unit.\r\n\r\nh1. Supplement\r\n\r\nIn Redmine3.X, there was a side effect that other destinations could be known by batch mailing.

Many email relays which require a user-id/pw login (e.g. smtp.gmail.com) replace the sender@domain with the user-id of the login account.  Consequently, when the receiver replies to the email, it goes to the login user-id and domain, rather than the sender user@domain set by redmine where the issue originated.\r\n\r\nThis patch provides a check-box in the email-notifications settings which, when set, causes redmine to provide a reply-to header identical to the sender (user@domain).  This allows replies to be routed to the redmine instance where they originated, and be incorporated into the issue.\r\n\r\nThe attached tarball of .diff files is for:\r\n  redmine-4.1.1\r\n  ruby 2.6.6p146  (not relevant)\r\n  Rails 5.2.4.2   (provides base mailer, not especially relevant)\r\n  mysql 5.7       (not relevant)\r\n  plugins: Additionals (not relevant)"}]}}

Otherwise the relation will be ignored.\r\n\r\nTo work around this limitation, the issue import could be extended to use multiple passes:\r\n\r\n# one to import basic issue properties\r\n# one to import relations to other issues\r\n\r\nThis way it becomes easier to create the CSV files for imports, since order is no longer important.\r\n\r\nThis change would also be a prerequisite to import general issue relations. Since those cannot be more complex that parent relations and cannot necessarily be linearized properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAttached you find a patch series based on trunk r15361.\r\n\r\nWhile implemented the changes, I tried to keep the @Import@ free from issue related information. Other existing @Import@ sub classes - within plugins e.g. - should need as little updates as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. 0001 Extend test data for issue import\r\n\r\nThis change adds two rows to the existing issue import fixture file. These rows contain a parent and a child issue, while the parent is placed after the child. This would not import properly given the current implementation.\r\n\r\nThe patch also updates the existing tests, where the number of imported issues is asserted.\r\n\r\nh3. 0002 Add test for issue relations to following rows\r\n\r\nThis patch extends the existing parent issue import test to also verify that the newly introduced parent child relation is properly imported. This test fails with the current implementation.\r\n\r\nh3. 0003 Multi-pass CSV import\r\n\r\nThis patch defines a @required_passes@ method within @Import@ which returns @1@ by default and may be overwritten in sub classes. The @IssueImport@ does so and returns @1@ if no @parent_id@ mapping was set, otherwise it returns @2@.\r\n\r\nThe @run@ method is split into @run@ and @run_pass@. The first one is recursive and called once for each pass. It also handles the @max_*@ options. The second is only responsible for reading the rows, creating or updating the ImportItems and passing everything to @build_object@.\r\n\r\nSince @build_object@ may now be called multiple times (once for each pass), the argument list was extended to provide more context. If somebody created a custom import in a plugin, this would need to be changed by the plugin's author.\r\n\r\nIn the @IssueImport@, @build_object@ is now split into @build_issue@ and @build_relations@, the first is called in the first pass, the second in pass 2.\r\n\r\nThe patch also contains a migration, which adds a @completed_passes@ field to @ImportItem@. This is needed to properly (re-)store progress for multi-step imports, like the ones via the web UI.\r\n\r\nFinally the patch adds some test to make sure, that the general behavior of multi-step imports did not change with the introduction of multi-pass imports.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Disclaimer*: I know, this is a rather large change to fix a minor nuisance. But as mentioned earlier, I think, this change is a necessary prerequisite to support importing \"Related Issues\" properly, which I would like to contribute next, if this patch is accepted."}]}}

And the second reason is that we want to us the import file as template, so there cannot be specific numbers.\r\n\r\nUseful would be a kind of dynamic link between the issues.

Usage\r\n\r\nThe attached patch extends the import configuration view with a new block, so that users may select a column for each relation type. The parent issue field also moved to the new block, since it's conceptually related.\r\n\r\nWithin the CSV file the columns may define multiple relations of the same type, each separated with @,@. Related issues follow the same rules as parent issues. A string preceded with a @#@ is supposed to be an existing issue. Without the @#@ it's supposed to be another row within the import file. For _follows_ and _precedes_ relations an additional delay may be present, e.g. @#12 3d@ specifying a relation to issue @#12@ and a delay of 3 days.\r\n\r\nh3. Technical notes\r\n\r\nSince issue relations may only be created when the issue was already saved, I've added a second step to the import. Additionally to @build_object@, which needs to be implemented by @Import@ sub classes, there's also a @extend_object@ method now. This is used by the @IssueImporter@ to save the relations after the issue was already saved successfully.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Additional considerations\r\n\r\nInitially, I wanted to build the import, so that issue relations exported from Redmine could be imported directly. But the format that's used by the exporter was designed for humans, not so much for computers. Most importantly, to parse this format we would need to grep for the localized relation names, which might even change between versions of Redmine. Therefore I settled for the proposed approach of having separate columns for each relation type."}]}}

Preface\r\n\r\nThe imports controller was obviously built to be used for more than just issue imports. But since Redmine currently only supports issue imports, there are now some places, where assumptions about the issue import are hard-coded.\r\n\r\nThere are some plugins out there, which add other kinds of CSV imports to Redmine, but none of them seems to use the imports controller. I assume, it's because of the shortcomings mentioned above. I wanted to improve this situation, so I decided to build a time entry importer and - along the way - generalize the imports controller so that it's able to handle more than just issues.\r\n\r\nh3. Preparations\r\n\r\nThe first patch attached extracts the issue related view parts into partials which are determined by convention. They are all prefixed with the imported model name, i.e. @_issues@. \r\n\r\nThe issue related model parts are moved to the import model. Those are, e.g. the proper menu item, the authorization or the layout. Strictly speaking they should be located on the controller level, but I did not want to build sub classes of the imports controller for each and every kind of import.\r\n\r\nh3. Adding the time entry import\r\n\r\nThe second patch attached adds the time entry import. It's using the newly introduced extension points to fill in the blanks. To provide a way for the user to find the new import, I've added the @timelog/_sidebar@ partial, similar to the one for issues. This new sidebar partial is now used in the timelog views and it contains a link to the import.\r\n\r\n*Note:* within said partial, I've mis/re-used an i18n key @label_time_entries_visibility_all@ since it was providing the desired text in German and English. I did not want to introduce a new key based on the existing one, since that would have probably caused major merge problems. If desired, I may of course do that anyway.\r\n\r\nh3. Closing notes\r\n\r\nThe second patch may of course also become a plugin. The main point of this patch (series) was it, to allow plugins to reuse the existing plugin infrastructure. Without the first patch though, a plugin author would need copy most of the views and functionality of the imports class, which is undesirable (at least for the plugin author).\r\n\r\nThank you for considering these patches."}]}}

But with above issue visibility this is not possible. We can add watchers, but of course, they do not see the issue.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, setting the issue visibility to \"All non private issues\" would allow them to see too much tickets.\r\n\r\nSo a combination would be great: general setting for visibility is \"Issues created by or assigned to the user\" but with the exceptional case, if a person is assigned as watcher.\r\nIt should be possible, that the watcher can see those issues, he has been added to.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."}]}}

Proposal\r\n\r\nIn Redmine4.0, other destinations are no longer displayed in the notification email.\r\n\r\nThis is a side effect of the following changes in Redmine 4.0.\r\nhttps://redmine.org/issues/26791\r\n\r\nDepending on the contents of the ticket, it may be necessary to confirm who is notified.\r\nFor example, the response may change depending on whether the trouble ticket content is delivered to the CEO.\r\n\r\nIn Redmine3.4, it was found from the To / Cc column of the notification email that the email was sent to someone else.\r\nIn Redmine 4.0 or later, you can not understand without checking the ticket.\r\n\r\nAlso, the amount sent to the person who has been set to \"notify all\" in the personal settings cannot be confirmed on the ticket.\r\n\r\nh1. Solution\r\n\r\nThere is no problem in sending individual emails.\r\nThe only inconvenience is that you can no longer check the simultaneous notification destination directly from the email.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the conventional To / Cc (watch) can be added to the beginning of the email text by setting the individual ID unit.\r\n\r\nh1. Supplement\r\n\r\nIn Redmine3.X, there was a side effect that other destinations could be known by batch mailing. (Specification changed in 4.0)\r\nIt seems that it was not recognized that there were cases where this was used as a substantial function.\r\n(In some cases, it may be necessary to respond depending on the email notification destination)\r\n\r\nYou can tell by checking the ticket from the link on the notification email, but it will be a burden if there are many cases.\r\n\r\n/* The following is a Japanese supplement */\r\n\r\nRedmine\u306e\u901a\u77e5\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u3001\u4ed6\u306e\u5b9b\u5148\u3092\u8868\u793a\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3059\u308b\r\n\r\n\u25a0\u63d0\u6848\u5185\u5bb9\r\n\r\nRedmine4.0\u306b\u3066\u3001\u901a\u77e5\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u4ed6\u306e\u5b9b\u5148\u304c\u8868\u793a\u3055\u308c\u306a\u304f\u306a\u3063\u305f\u3002\r\n\r\n\u3053\u308c\u306fRedmine4.0\u306e\u4e0b\u8a18\u5909\u66f4\u306b\u3088\u308b\u526f\u4f5c\u7528\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3002\r\nhttps://redmine.org/issues/26791\r\n\r\n\u30c1\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u5185\u5bb9\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u306f\u3001\u4ed6\u306e\u8ab0\u306b\u901a\u77e5\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304b\u78ba\u8a8d\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u5834\u5408\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3002\r\n\u4f8b\u3048\u3070\u3001\u30c8\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u306e\u30c1\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u5185\u5bb9\u304cCEO\u306b\u914d\u4fe1\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304b\u3069\u3046\u304b\u3067\u3001\u5bfe\u5fdc\u304c\u5909\u308f\u308b\u5834\u5408\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3002\r\n\r\nRedmine3.4\u306e\u6642\u306f\u3001\u901a\u77e5\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb\u306eTo/Cc\u6b04\u304b\u3089\u3001\u4ed6\u306e\u8ab0\u306b\u9001\u4fe1\u3055\u308c\u305f\u304b\u5224\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001\r\nRedmine4.0\u4ee5\u964d\u3067\u306f\u30c1\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u78ba\u8a8d\u3057\u306a\u3044\u3068\u5224\u3089\u306a\u3044\u3002\r\n\r\n\u307e\u305f\u3001\u500b\u4eba\u8a2d\u5b9a\u3067\u300c\u3059\u3079\u3066\u901a\u77e5\u300d\u306b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u4eba\u3078\u306e\u9001\u4fe1\u5206\u306f\u3001\u30c1\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u4e0a\u304b\u3089\u78ba\u8a8d\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u3002\r\n\r\n\u25a0\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56\r\n\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u500b\u5225\u9001\u4fe1\u81ea\u4f53\u306b\u306f\u554f\u984c\u306a\u3044\u3002\r\n\u540c\u6642\u901a\u77e5\u5148\u3092\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb\u304b\u3089\u76f4\u63a5\u78ba\u8a8d\u3067\u304d\u306a\u304f\u306a\u3063\u305f\u306e\u304c\u4e0d\u4fbf\u306a\u3060\u3051\u3002\r\n\r\n\u500b\u4ebaID\u5358\u4f4d\u306e\u8a2d\u5b9a\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u5f93\u6765\u306eTo/Cc(watch) \u3092\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb\u30c6\u30ad\u30b9\u30c8\u5148\u982d\u306b\u4ed8\u3051\u3089\u308c\u308c\u3070\u826f\u3044\u3068\u601d\u308f\u308c\u308b\u3002\r\n\r\n\u25a0\u88dc\u8db3\r\nRedmine3.X\u3067\u306f\u3001\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb\u4e00\u62ec\u9001\u4fe1\u306b\u3088\u308a\u4ed6\u306e\u9001\u4fe1\u5148\u304c\u5224\u308b\u3068\u3044\u3046\u526f\u4f5c\u7528\u304c\u3042\u3063\u305f\u3002\uff084.0\u3067\u4ed5\u69d8\u5909\u66f4\uff09\r\n\u3053\u308c\u3092\u5b9f\u8cea\u7684\u306a\u6a5f\u80fd\u3068\u3057\u3066\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u5834\u5408\u304c\u3042\u3063\u305f\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3001\u8a8d\u8b58\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3068\u601d\u308f\u308c\u308b\u3002\r\n\uff08\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb\u901a\u77e5\u5148\u306b\u3088\u308a\u5bfe\u5fdc\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u3082\u3042\u308b\uff09\r\n\r\n\u901a\u77e5\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb\u4e0a\u306e\u30ea\u30f3\u30af\u304b\u3089\u30c1\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u78ba\u8a8d\u3059\u308c\u3070\u5224\u308b\u304c\u3001\u4ef6\u6570\u304c\u591a\u3051\u308c\u3070\u8ca0\u62c5\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3002\r\n\r\n\u672c\u30c1\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u5bfe\u5fdc\u306f\u4e0b\u8a18\u306b\u8a18\u8f09\u3057\u307e\u3059\r\nhttps://redmine.tokyo/issues/1083\r\n"}]}}

They could e.g. lack both a priority and a subject altogether or lack a priority and substitute the subject attribute with a title or name attribute in the form of a custom field.\r\n\r\nI think it would be great if Redmine could support such configurations without the need for users/admins to resort to (custom) workarounds. That way, the bare minimum of issue attributes would consist of only the status attribute (by disabling all the fields in the tracker config combined with setting the remaining fields to read-only in the workflow field permissions).\r\n\r\nUse-case examples:\r\n* collection management (books/movies/CDs/DVDs/BDs/recipes, etc.)\r\n* (software) license management\r\n* inventory management\r\n* contact management\r\n* vacation-/presence management\r\n* appointment management\r\n* etc.\r\n\r\nIn the case that such entities are tracked as Redmine issues, an administrator can already modify/override the respective Redmine core translations easily via a plugin to globally rename 'issues' into a more general term like 'items'. This cannot be done with the same ease to e.g. rename the subject attribute to a title attribute as issues of other trackers (e.g. an old-school defect tracker) use the same attribute OOTB, hence the request to also make the subject attribute disablable."}]}}
