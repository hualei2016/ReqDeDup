Introduce a feature that exports a version's details as a changelog text file, including version number, release date, and a list of associated issues (defects, features, patches) with brief descriptions. This can be accessed via a \"TXT\" export option on the version page, facilitating the creation of changelogs.\n2. Extend Redmine's text formatting syntax to include a new link format for issues that displays the issue's subject directly after the link. For instance, using `#124:` would generate a link to issue #124 followed by its subject, allowing users to preview the issue's topic without needing to open the actual issue link.\n\nThese enhancements would collectively improve the management and readability of project changelogs and issue references within Redmine."}}],"usage":{"completion_tokens":300,"prompt_tokens":776,"total_tokens":1076},"system_fingerprint":null}},"error":null}
