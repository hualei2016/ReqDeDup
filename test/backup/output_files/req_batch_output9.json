Implement custom field permissions for spent time, mirroring the \"Issue custom fields permissions\" feature.

Consider introducing conditional logic to spent time custom fields, where their visibility or mandatory status can change depending on the progression of the issue or the user accessing the information.\n\nThis combined requirement addresses both the technical compatibility issue and the permission control request but given the low similarity probability, it's important to treat these as separate improvements in practice."}}],"usage":{"completion_tokens":328,"prompt_tokens":317,"total_tokens":645},"system_fingerprint":null}},"error":null}

This enhancement will cover:\n   - Inlining images directly in content,\n   - Generating thumbnails for attached images,\n   - Facilitating easy markup insertion for drag-and-drop uploaded images.\n\n2. **Lazy Loading for Images:** Apply the `loading=\"lazy\"` attribute to all inline images and thumbnails rendered by Redmine to defer their loading until they are within the viewport. This technique, as documented in [Lazy Loading](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Lazy_loading), significantly speeds up initial page rendering, especially beneficial when issues contain numerous comments with many images."}}],"usage":{"completion_tokens":316,"prompt_tokens":320,"total_tokens":636},"system_fingerprint":null}},"error":null}
