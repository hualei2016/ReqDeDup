Concurrently, embark on an initiative to fully internationalize the system's help documentation, ensuring all help resources are adaptable for localization, thus improving accessibility for a global user base.

First, introduce the ability to attach documentation to each issue status, particularly custom ones, providing tooltips that explain the intended use and meaning of each status during ticket updates. Second, display a journal count on the issues list, reflecting the number of updates or comments made on each issue, to give users a quick insight into an issue's activity level without needing to open it. This combined approach will ensure clarity in status application and facilitate efficient monitoring of issue progress."}}],"usage":{"completion_tokens":240,"prompt_tokens":258,"total_tokens":498},"system_fingerprint":null}},"error":null}
