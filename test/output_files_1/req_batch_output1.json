The implementation should allow plugins to perform necessary post-save actions when issues are updated in bulk, maintaining transactional safety and providing the necessary parameters for each issue being processed. A community-contributed patch is available at https://github.com/7citylearning/redmine/commit/f88c6ca01e89246b5bcd62fa26cc651ee33ba212, which can serve as a starting point for this enhancement."}}],"usage":{"completion_tokens":271,"prompt_tokens":582,"total_tokens":853},"system_fingerprint":null}},"error":null}

Ticket1 focuses on advanced relation handling during import to maintain links between tickets when rows are deleted, ensuring the correct relational ID remains consistent.
