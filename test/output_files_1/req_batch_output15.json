This modification will facilitate the creation of filters using Gmail's list operator based on projects, allowing users to categorize and manage project-related emails more effectively.\n\n    The new implementation should dynamically generate the List-Id as follows: `<project_identifier>.<emission_email_domain>`. For instance, with an emission email of `redmine@example.net` and a project identifier of `ecookbook`, the List-Id would be `List-Id: <ecookbook.redmine.example.net>`.\n\n    To ensure backward compatibility and flexibility for users who rely on the current List-Id format, introduce a configurable setting in the Administration > Settings page.

This would address scenarios where limiting access to modules like \"Time Tracking,\" \"Gantt,\" and \"Calendar\" could reduce clutter and focus the user's attention on essential functions such as issue submission and tracking.\n\n2. **Issue Navigation URL Simplification**: Introduce an option to either disable the issue navigation feature or remove the verbose URL parameters it generates (e.g., issue_count, issue_position, next_issue_id, prev_issue_id). The goal is to provide cleaner URLs akin to `https://redmine.com/issues/1234`, enhancing usability and avoiding potential issues caused by lengthy URLs.\n\nThese combined enhancements would significantly contribute to a more user-centric and efficient Redmine platform."}}],"usage":{"completion_tokens":321,"prompt_tokens":444,"total_tokens":765},"system_fingerprint":null}},"error":null}

This will involve creating an admin setting to define the aging threshold and implementing the anonymization process, which could replace personally identifiable information with anonymous placeholders, ensuring data minimization principles are upheld.\n\n2. **User Privacy in Public Projects**: Modify Redmine's default behavior to restrict public disclosure of user account names, especially for users of public projects. Introduce an optional \"Public Display Nickname\" field for users, separate from their login credentials, to be shown publicly while keeping their actual usernames private. Additionally, implement options to add \"noindex\" metadata to user and group pages to discourage search engines from indexing personal data, thereby protecting user privacy online.\n\nThese changes will collectively strengthen Redmine's adherence to GDPR guidelines by addressing data anonymization and user privacy exposure in public contexts."}}],"usage":{"completion_tokens":356,"prompt_tokens":692,"total_tokens":1048},"system_fingerprint":null}},"error":null}

This feature should ensure that, instead of merely setting deleted user data as \"Anonymous,\" it systematically anonymizes the content while preserving necessary records.\n\nAdditionally, update the official Redmine documentation to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date guide on the process and consequences of deleting users.
