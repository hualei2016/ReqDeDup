This will be achieved by modifying login forms with `<INPUT TYPE=\"password\" AUTOCOMPLETE=\"off\">` to mitigate the risk of stolen sessions and credentials on compromised machines.\n\n- Enforce strong password policies for all new user accounts, particularly those created by admin users. This includes setting minimum length requirements, mandating the use of a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special characters, and possibly implementing password expiration or periodic prompts to change passwords to ensure ongoing security.\n\nThese measures collectively aim to strengthen Redmine's defense against common attack vectors targeting user authentication and authorization."}}],"usage":{"completion_tokens":326,"prompt_tokens":324,"total_tokens":650},"system_fingerprint":null}},"error":null}
