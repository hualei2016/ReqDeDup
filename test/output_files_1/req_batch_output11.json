This would allow developers and project managers to establish issue relationships effortlessly, without needing to save the issue first and then add the relation separately. For example, \"@/relate #1234@\" could automatically link the current issue with issue #1234 upon saving.\n2. Implement a quick update functionality that lets users submit status updates or notes to an issue without requiring them to navigate into the edit mode.
