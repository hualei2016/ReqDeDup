This would allow for tailored access where certain issues can be restricted to particular users (e.g., U1, U2 for Issue Aa) without inadvertently exposing those issues to others (like U3, U4).\n\n2. **Watcher Exemption from Visibility Rules:** Introduce a configuration that permits watchers to view and receive notifications for issues they are added to, even if their default issue visibility setting is restrictive (e.g., \"Issues created by or assigned to the user\"). This exemption would ensure necessary collaboration while maintaining overall privacy compliance and minimizing information exposure.\n\nThis combined feature would address both the need for precise issue-level privacy controls and the capability to bypass these restrictions for a selected group of users acting as watchers, all within the bounds of predefined privacy policies."}}],"usage":{"completion_tokens":389,"prompt_tokens":629,"total_tokens":1018},"system_fingerprint":null}},"error":null}

There's an urgent need to prevent unauthorized access to certain issues and maintain data confidentiality between different user groups or organizations.\n\n        **Requirement:**\n        Develop an enhanced issue visibility feature that allows administrators to set custom visibility permissions on a per-issue basis, enabling them to restrict access to specific users or user groups only. This should address the following concerns:\n\n        1. **Granular User Control:** Each issue should support assignment of visibility permissions to individual users beyond the project's default settings, ensuring that only intended recipients like U1, U2 for Issue Aa, and U3, U4 for Issue Ab and Ac, can view those respective issues.\n\n        2. **Group-Based Visibility:** Extend visibility settings to accommodate group memberships, allowing issues to be visible only to members of specific groups associated with different organizations. This ensures developers from one organization do not inadvertently access issues belonging to another organization or group.\n\n        3. **Prevent Unauthorized Access:** Ensure changes in visibility settings for one issue do not inadvertently grant or revoke access to other issues, thus mitigating the risk of internal fraud and maintaining the integrity of information barriers.\n\n        By implementing these enhancements, we aim to improve project management efficiency while safeguarding sensitive information and respecting organizational boundaries.\n\n        _Thank you for considering this improvement.

Introduce sidebar hooks to facilitate extension by plugin developers, encouraging a more modular and customizable system. Refactor the sidebar to use a structured list for repositories and employ a unified `link_to_repository` helper function, accompanied by comprehensive tests to maintain functionality.\n\nBoth improvements aim to streamline the user experience and extend the extensibility of the repository management system."}}],"usage":{"completion_tokens":292,"prompt_tokens":373,"total_tokens":665},"system_fingerprint":null}},"error":null}

However, if we were to consider a combined scope based on their commonality, it might look something like this:\n\n**Subject:** Enhance Notification & Visibility Settings for Watchers and New Users\n\n**Description:** Modify Redmine's default behavior and introduce configuration options to improve user experience and privacy management regarding notifications and issue visibility, especially for new users and watchers. \n\n1. Change the default notification option for new users to \"Only for things I watch or I am assigned to\" (internal_name: only_assigned), ensuring that users do not receive unintended notifications after unwatching an issue they created, given the auto-watch feature enabled by default in Redmine 5.1.0.\n\n2. Implement a new visibility setting that allows watchers to view and receive email notifications for issues they are specifically added to, even if the project's general visibility is set to \"Issues created by or assigned to the user.\" This exception ensures necessary collaboration without compromising the overall restricted view as per GDPR and internal policies.\n\nThese adjustments aim to strike a balance between user control over notifications, collaboration efficiency through watching, and maintaining appropriate levels of issue visibility across the platform."}}],"usage":{"completion_tokens":365,"prompt_tokens":820,"total_tokens":1185},"system_fingerprint":null}},"error":null}

The current default setting, \"Only for things I watch or I'm involved in\" (internal_name: only_my_events), which includes notifications for issues the user authors, assigns, or watches, often leads to unintended notification scenarios due to auto-watching.\n\nThe proposed adjustment is to change the default setting to \"Only for things I watch or I am assigned to\" (internal_name: only_assigned). This new default will ensure users only receive notifications when they are directly assigned to an issue or have manually chosen to watch it. Consequently, it remedies potential confusion by allowing users to effectively manage their notifications by unwatching issues without conflicting with the system's auto-watch functionality. This update aligns with user expectations and addresses concerns raised in feature requests #6914 and #27135 for more controlled notification management."}}],"usage":{"completion_tokens":331,"prompt_tokens":1112,"total_tokens":1443},"system_fingerprint":null}},"error":null}
