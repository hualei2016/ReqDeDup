This update ensures project managers can swiftly correct misallocated time entries by allowing them to change the associated project, with automatic adjustments to hour types and other details based on the selected project.

While the first ticket (Ticket1) provides a more detailed proposal focusing on the 'Activity' page, including specific events like project creation and changes to project fields, the second ticket (Ticket2) is more concise but still asks for a project activity log to track actions such as closing or reopening a project. The underlying objective of enhancing project transparency and accountability is shared by both tickets.\n* New Requirement:\n    ** Subject: Enhanced Project Activity Tracking on 'Activity' Page\n    ** Description: \n        To improve project transparency and management oversight, we propose integrating a comprehensive project activity tracking feature into Redmine's 'Activity' page. This enhancement will encompass the following key aspects:\n\n        - **Project Lifecycle Events**: Log significant milestones, such as the creation, closure, and reopening of projects, along with details of the initiator and timestamp.\n        - **Project Detail Modifications**: Display changes made to project attributes, including standard fields (e.g., project name, description) and custom fields, with a visual diff to highlight modifications clearly.\n        - **User Accountability**: Ensure every logged activity is attributed to the user responsible, facilitating audit trails and issue resolution.\n\n    By implementing this feature, Redmine users will gain insights into project-level activities, enabling better collaboration, decision-making, and troubleshooting. Our team is eager to collaborate with the Redmine development team on this initiative, adhering to the platform's coding standards and contributing to a seamless integration of this functionality."}}],"usage":{"completion_tokens":319,"prompt_tokens":438,"total_tokens":757},"system_fingerprint":null}},"error":null}
