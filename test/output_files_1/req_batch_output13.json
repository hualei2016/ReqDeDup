Users are advised to migrate to a supported Ruby version to ensure compatibility and continued security updates.\n\nThese changes ensure Redmine remains up-to-date with the latest stable and secure technologies, enhancing performance and maintaining a robust security posture for all users."}}],"usage":{"completion_tokens":353,"prompt_tokens":403,"total_tokens":756},"system_fingerprint":null}},"error":null}
