This feature utilizes the 'roo' gem to facilitate seamless ODX file processing.\n    \n    - **Pre-Validation & Mapping Enhancements**: Introduce a pre-import validation step and a more intuitive mapping interface where users can pre-validate mappings and see potential import issues before execution. The mapping process will be reversed, allowing users to map internal entities to data columns for greater control and efficiency.\n    \n    - **Project Members Import Wizard**: Specifically, introduce a streamlined workflow for importing project members, ensuring accurate assignment and quick onboarding within projects, reducing administrative overhead.\n\nThis combined requirement suggests a comprehensive upgrade to Redmine's import system, addressing various pain points and enhancing the overall user experience without duplicating efforts."}}],"usage":{"completion_tokens":412,"prompt_tokens":372,"total_tokens":784},"system_fingerprint":null}},"error":null}

The format will permit issue IDs or references to other rows within the import for creating relations, with optional delays for time-dependent relations like 'precedes' and 'follows'.\n\nThe implementation will involve modifying the import configuration interface to include these new settings and adding an additional step to the import process to process issue relations after the issues have been saved.

Ticket1 is about compatibility of a specific plugin (Redmine Timesheets Application) with a particular Redmine version (4.2.3), whereas Ticket2 discusses the end of development for the entire Redmine 4.x series and the implications of the transition in terms of Rails versions and community expectations. There's no overlap in the subject matter or the actions required, hence they should not be duplicated.\n* New Requirement: Not applicable since the probability of duplication is below 70%. However, if we were to imagine a scenario where these concerns somehow converge, it might look like this:\n\n**Subject**: Update Communication & Compatibility for Redmine Timesheets App Post-4.2.3\n\n**Description**: \nGiven the anticipation of ending Redmine 4.x development after the 4.2 release and the ongoing transition in the Rails framework, clarify the future support plans and compatibility of the Redmine ecosystem, specifically focusing on upgrading the Redmine Timesheets Application to ensure compatibility with the final stable 4.x version (4.2.3) and outlining its integration path with upcoming Redmine versions beyond 4.x. This includes a public communication plan to address user inquiries and manage expectations regarding further updates and support for the application."}}],"usage":{"completion_tokens":266,"prompt_tokens":400,"total_tokens":666},"system_fingerprint":null}},"error":null}

This would ensure that whenever an issue transitions to a specified status (e.g., \"Done\"), a user must provide a note before proceeding, promoting accountability and improving documentation.\n\n2. **Status-Based Reminder Configuration:** Expand reminder settings to allow users to set reminders based on issue status exclusions or inclusions. For instance, enable the exclusion of resolved issues from reminder notifications, similar to how closed issues are currently handled, providing more granular control over which status changes trigger reminders.\n\nThough integrated into one request for the sake of exploration, these are distinct features that should be considered and developed separately."}}],"usage":{"completion_tokens":307,"prompt_tokens":382,"total_tokens":689},"system_fingerprint":null}},"error":null}
