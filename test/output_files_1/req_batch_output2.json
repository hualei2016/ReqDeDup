Second, it will introduce internationalization features to custom fields, enabling administrators to create and manage custom field labels in multiple languages.

This enhancement will introduce two new features:\n\n1. **Status-Based Reminder Filtering:** Allow users to specify a comma-separated list of issue status IDs when triggering reminder tasks via a rake command. By default, reminders will consider all issue statuses but can be tailored to notify only for selected statuses (e.g., `bundle exec rake redmine:send_reminders statuses='1,2' RAILS_ENV='development'`).\n\n2. **Issue Involvement Filters:**\n   - **Updated By Filter:** Enable filtering of issues based on any user who has previously updated the issue, providing a view of general involvement across multiple updates.\n   - **Last Updated By Filter:** Introduce a filter to specifically identify issues based on the most recent user to have made changes, helping track the latest interactions.\n\nAdditionally, include these new filtering criteria as selectable columns within the issue view to enhance visibility and reporting capabilities. Ensure these enhancements integrate seamlessly with the existing Redmine codebase and provide a reliable alternative to third-party plugins addressing similar needs."}}],"usage":{"completion_tokens":361,"prompt_tokens":379,"total_tokens":740},"system_fingerprint":null}},"error":null}
