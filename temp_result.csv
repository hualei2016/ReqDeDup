** Description: To improve user understanding and workflow efficiency, implement two complementary features: 
1. Allow administrators to add descriptive tooltips to each issue status, particularly custom ones, explaining their meaning and guiding users on when to apply them. This will ensure consistent use of statuses across the platform.
2. Display a journal count on the issues list view, indicating the level of activity for each issue. This will give users an immediate insight into how actively a ticket has been worked on without needing to open it, enhancing the overall visibility of issue progress and engagement."

** Subject: Enhanced Time Tracking Flexibility and User Permissions

** Description: This feature request aims to enhance the time tracking functionality in two ways. First, it would enable users to log time on behalf of others, addressing scenarios where team members might be unavailable to update their tasks亲自. This would include safeguards to ensure proper authorization checks both at the view and controller levels to maintain data integrity.

Secondly, the system would be adapted to support various units for time tracking, going beyond the conventional hours and minutes. Users could choose to track their work in alternative units such as points, to align with specific project management methodologies, or utilize ""tomato"" units popularized by the Pomodoro Technique. This enhancement would provide teams with more tailored and versatile options for quantifying their work efforts."
