41180,Tracker 'closed' -> Status 'closed' automatically,Michael Koch,New,"","Hi 

I use several Trackers that indicate that the issue is 'done/finished'.

Is there an option that the Status automatically switch to a 'closed' issue Status?

The reason is simple:
* I don't want to modify always to fields in the issue
* the Overview remains issues that are already solved

It would be great if somebody has an idea."
41044,Add hook call in my page,Akihiro Sada,New,"","While writing the plugin, I realized that there is no hook available in ""app/views/my/page.html.erb""."
41037,Export/Import one Project on Redmine,Louis Nguyen,New,"","My user accidentally deleted a project, and now he wants me to restore it. I have restored a VM running the most recent backup version, but the problem now is I don't know how to migrate the project to the VM redmine is using.
Please help me any way to migrate project form old server to current server. I'm using redmine 5.1.3"
40970,Emoji reactions on notes in Issues,Aidan Horn,New,"","Similar to how [GitHub features emoji reactions on issue comments](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/), could Redmine please develop emoji reactions on notes in issues in Redmine?
This would allow people to explicitly acknowledge that they've read a note, without having to leave another short note to reply."
40890,Show project changes on 'Activity' page,Boris Brodski,New,"","We would like to propose a new feature for Redmine: displaying project changes on the 'Activity' page. The idea is to enhance the visibility and traceability of modifications related to projects. Specifically, we propose that at least the following events be included on the 'Activity' page of each project:

* Project Creation: Log the creation of new projects.
* Changes to Project Fields: Track and display changes made to project fields such as the project name, description, etc.
* Changes to Project Custom Fields: Include modifications made to custom fields associated with the project.

Each of these events should be shown with the author, date, and a diff (similar to how changes to issues and other entities are currently displayed). This feature will significantly improve the transparency and management of project changes.

Implementation Participation:

If this feature request is approved, we are ready and willing to participate in its implementation. We seek guidance and support from core developers to ensure our contributions align with Redmine’s standards and best practices.

We believe this addition will be valuable for many users and look forward to collaborating with the Redmine development team to bring this enhancement to life.

Thank you for considering our request."
40784,Add feature to get raw Textile/Markdown text in notes and descriptions,Mizuki ISHIKAWA,New,"","There are instances where I need the raw, unprocessed text from journal comments and descriptions written in Textile or Markdown, rather than the HTML-converted information. This is particularly necessary when I want to write a new comment based on the information displayed in these formats. Additionally, there are times when I need to add information to tables written in Textile or Markdown. Without access to the raw text, I would have to recreate the table from scratch.

While it is possible to obtain the raw text from the input fields if I have editing permissions for the comments, such permissions are not always available. Another alternative is to use the quote feature, but this is not a complete solution as it adds quotation marks and can omit some of the original formatting.

I have attached an image that illustrates the requested feature.

40744,Refresh history tabs look and feel,Marius BĂLTEANU,New,Related to #39880,"The current UI of the history tab looks quite confusing because of the many borders. For some heading we started to add a background color (ex: Activity page) and I think we should also add to the history tab. Looking on some active themes, I saw some quite nice implementations:

1.Simple change to show gravatar inside the heading:

2. From redmine_theme_farend_bleuclair theme maintained by Farend (@maeda).

40726,Disable jumping to journal's note after updating the issue,Dmitry Nekrasov,Needs feedback,"","Current functionality automatically scrolls the page to new note, after issue is updated. It is not handy if you are updating some issues's fields, sumbit it and want to continue working with issues further — you have to scroll page back to the top after each update.

Is it possible to turn jumping to new note's anchor link in Redmine 5.1.1?"
40711,Better error messages for LDAP authentication,Aleksandar Pavic,New,"","For example, 

if user does not have email attribute set

it just gives error ""Failed login for `user...` from IP 

regardless of debug/production environment.

Proper error would be to give more info from LDAP like
missing email or a bit more debug detais for other potential problems.
"
40699,Split custom fields admin page in varios sheets or pages,Yazan Televes,New,"","Dear developes, hope it can be possible to make a small plugin to help people who have many custom fields in their installation, dividing the custom fields administration page in many pages and showing only 100 or 200 fields per page. We are having the problem explained in this ticket:(https://www.redmine.org/boards/2/topics/69686) because we have a 2200 custom fields, and it would be very helpfull to have a plugin that allows to navigate between them in efficient way.
Thanks a lot.
"
40588,Ability to disable table sort,Josiah Ulfers,Needs feedback,Related to #1718,"I find the table sorting introduced by #1718 annoying because most of the tables I use are not usefully sortable and the sort as implemented can be a nuisance.

I would like an *option to turn off the JavaScript sorting globally*, that is, restore the behavior prior to #1718.

Globally might mean ""per project."" I use Redmine hosted on Planio and I'm not sure how the clients there are technically separated.

----

The specific problems are immaterial if there's an option to turn off table sorting, but I'll show the problems as motivation.

For example, I use tables like this:

|_. First group   | Gizmos A |
|_. Second        | Widgets B |
|_/2. Third       | Widgets A |
                  | Gizmos B |
|_. Fourth        | Gadgets |


Hovering table headers causes the sort arrow to appear briefly. That changes the dimensions of the cells and can cause a jarring blinking effect as the table columns resize.

It's hard to _select_ part of the text in a table cell. If I click and drag over just the word ""first"" for example, when I let up the mouse button, it sorts instead of keeping my selection. I can work around this by moving the mouse outside the cell before letting up the button, but that's easily forgotten.

Once I've sorted the table one time, often by accident as above, no amount of clicking returns it to the original order. An example table on [[RedmineTextFormattingTextile]] suffers from this problem as well.

The example table from [[RedmineTextFormattingTextile]] also shows that apparently the same sorting choice can produce different orderings.

| !{height:100px}clipboard-202404181831-c0ryh.png! | !{height:100px}clipboard-202404181833-tgair.png! |

That might be related to improper handling of row and column spans. With the simpler example here, a rowspan can rearrange cells into the wrong columns and associate them with the wrong headers.

|_. Original |_. Sorted |
| !{height:100px}clipboard-202404181812-io99s.png! | !{height:100px}clipboard-202404181812-vdkwz.png! |

#1718#note-17 lists some other potential problems.

----

Wiki syntax to disable sort per table or per column would be an alternative. Such syntax might already exist since #1718 says I can ""explicitly set the sort algorithm by adding one of the following classNames to the associated table header… sortable-keep (which keeps the row in it’s original order)."" Forgive my ignorance, but I don't know how to add classNames in wiki syntax, [[RedmineTextFormattingTextile]] doesn't mention it.

For me, however, removing JavaScript sort or a global option to turn it off would be better that fine-grained wiki syntax."
40552,Activate CustomField when status changes,Thomas Le Large,New,"","Hello,

I'd like to know if it's possible to automate a task using a custom workflow for this type of action.

When the status of a request changes from ""Transmitted"" to ""Accepted with reserves"", a custom field that was not initially visible on this tracker should appear at that moment and remain until the ticket is closed. This custom field is called ""Background"" and takes the form of a drop-down list with different values.

If you know how to code this in a custom workflow, I'd love to know ;)

40450,Add API-Request for fetching Journals which has changed since a certain date/time,Thomas Hoffmann,New,Related to #40449,"We want to synchronize the redmine issues with our internal system.
For this purpose, we need a feature to fetch changed journal entries of an issue.
Editing a journal entry doesn't change the updated_on field of the issue.

Therefore, we would like to have a GET call like:
<pre>
https://domain.com/journals.json?updated_on=%3E%3D2024-03-25T07%3A24%3A03Z

40422,Print name and email to request that was create through email,Filip Skřivánek,New,"","We have introduced an enhancement to our email-based task creation functionality.

Traditionally, we have utilized the IMAP method for generating new tasks through emails, as detailed on the Redmine documentation page: https://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/redminereceivingemails#Fetching-emails-from-an-IMAP-server.

Due to security considerations, we opted against using the parameter unknown_user=""create"" which would automatically create a new Redmine user if the email sender wasn't recognized. Instead, we chose the unknown_user=""accept"" setting. This approach, however, resulted in tasks that seemed to be created by an anonymous user, without indicating the email sender's identity.

To address this issue, we've added a novel parameter ""insert_name_and_email_to_description"". When set to 1, this parameter ensures that the sender's name and email address are included in the first line of the task description in the format <<<[name-from-header];[email-sender]>>> as illustrated in the attached screenshot.

!Screenshot%202024-03-18%20at%2013.24.09.png!

Below is an example of how we invoke the script with this new parameter:

<pre><code class=""shell"">
/opt/bitnami/ruby/bin/bundle exec /opt/bitnami/ruby/bin/rake redmine:email:receive_imap RAILS_ENV=""production"" host=""xxx"" username=""xxx"" password=""xxx"" unknown_user=""accept"" no_permission_check=1 project=""xxx"" no_account_notice=1 insert_name_and_email_to_description=1 --trace
</code></pre>

It's important to note that the ""insert_name_and_email_to_description"" parameter is optional. If it's not set, or if its value is 0, the functionality reverts to its previous behavior.

I am also attaching a ""patch"" file detailing these modifications against the last commit on the master branch in our git repository."

40415,Document Journals API,Holger Just,New,"","#10171 added an API to update journal's notes. This should be documented in the Wiki, namely ""Rest_Journals"":/projects/redmine/wiki/Rest_Journals?parent=Rest_api"
40411,The watch button/link should show if the issue is watched by group,Felix Schäfer,New,Related to #4511,"When a user watches an issue because of a group membership and the user does not have the `view_issue_watchers` permission, the user cannot see that she is watching the issue.

Currently the button link shows:
- ""Watch"" when the user is not watching the issue or watching via a group
- ""Unwatch"" when the user is watching the issue

It would be possible to show a third state for the button/link:
- ""Watch"" when the user is not watching the issue
- ""Watched by group"" when the user is not watching the issue but is watching the issue via a group
- ""Unwatch"" when the user is watching the issue

The button/link would toggle between first and third state when the user is not also watching the issue via a group, and between second and third state when the user is also watching via a group."
40299,Subproject to inherit the wiki from project,Alexandre Camsonne,New,"","Hello,

not sure if that was already requested,

but I was thinking it would be convenient that if a subproject does not have wiki module checked, it inherits from wiki of parent project so all subproject wiki could be consolidated in the parent wiki.

So far only solution I see is to make a table of links to subproject wiki in the parent project wiki manually which is not practical. Or if an link to the subproject wiki would be automatically created in the parent wiki that would work too but sounds more complicated"
40277,Set day as non-working for purposes of Precedes and Following relationships,Dotan Cohen,New,"","In my opinion Redmine would benefit from the ability to set a specific, non-recurring day as a non-work day.

40266,Proposal to Include Direct Links to Attached Files in PDF Exports of Issues,Yazan Al aeddin,New,"","

40149,Drop deprecated Redcarpet based Markdown formatter,Go MAEDA,New,"","In Redmine 5.1, the Redcarpet-based Markdown formatter is deprecated and CommonMark Markdown is the default instead.

40103,"Allow to ""watch"" projects to get notifications",Jens Krämer,New,"","As discussed in #39854, having the option to ""watch"" projects would give users a straight forward way to subscribe to notifications about project activity, similar to watching an issue subscribes to notifications about activity regarding this issue.

39882,Highlight selected version on the Roadmap view,Mischa The Evil,New,"","It can be helpful to have the selected version's heading highlighted on the Roadmap (@versions#index@) view. This would also be in line with what we currently already have for selected issue journals, forum topic replies (i.e. messages) and wiki page headings.
This proposed highlight could have a border-radius dependent of #39880."
39881,Improve progress bars,Mischa The Evil,New,"","I think that the UI of the progress bars in Redmine could benefit from some TLC:
* improve and modernize the HTML structure (inspiration for this can be gathered from old ChiliProject issue ""CP #1056"":https://www.chiliproject.org/issues/1056 [""PR #213 at GitHub"":https://github.com/chiliproject/chiliproject/pull/213]... );
* add a small (3px?) border-radius to the outer borders."
39880,Add a small border-radius to selected (author) headings,Mischa The Evil,New,Related to #40744,"Now that border-radius is already sparsely used in the Redmine core, there are three additional places that I've come across where a small border-radius (3px?) would be nice to have:
* selected issue journals
** {{collapse(CSS selector:)
<pre><code class=""css"">#history div:target h4.note-header</code></pre>
}} 
* selected forum topic replies (i.e. messages)
** {{collapse(CSS selector:)
<pre><code class=""css"">#replies .reply:target h4.reply-header</code></pre>
}}
* selected wiki page headings
** {{collapse(CSS selector:)
<pre><code class=""css"">div.wiki a:target + h1, div.wiki a:target + h2, div.wiki a:target + h3, div.wiki a:target + h4, div.wiki a:target + h5, div.wiki a:target + h6</code></pre>
}}

There actually is a fourth place, but that one (the progress bars) needs, IMHO, more work first and in addition to it, so I'll leave it out of this issue to keep this small and easy.
-- _author edit: this is now tracked in #39881._

39783,Email notification settings,Donald Martin,New,"","Hi 

It would be great if we had more flexibility in email setup for non registered users - I hope you can help?

Would it be possible to look at having a per project option of using default email address or custom address when sending out email alerts?

Also at present its only project members who are able to receive ticket updates, could it be possible to have a cc field in which you could specify other email address (non registered users) when making ticket updates.

These two options combined would make the workflow of ticket handling for non registered users a lot slicker.

39774,Add logging for issue deletion,Go MAEDA,New,Related to #25924,"The attached patch introduces a new feature in the Issue model to log every issue deletion, enhancing audit trails.

My clients sometimes ask me to identify when and who deleted an issue, especially when deletions are accidental. For a single issue, you can pinpoint the responsible user by finding a line in the production.log that begins with ""DELETE /issues/"". From the following log, for instance, shows that ""admin"" deleted issue @#1@ at 2023-12-04 21:30:11.

However, identifying deletions is not possible when multiple issues are involved. For example, if issue @#1@ with subtask @#15@ and @#16@ is deleted, the log does not record the deletion of these subtasks. This lack of detailed logging poses a significant auditing problem.

To address this, the attached patch ensures that a ""Deleted issue: ..."" line is output to the production.log for each deleted issue, as shown below. This enhancement allows for comprehensive tracking of issue deletions.

39733,"Make it possible to change the logo with a custom image (support svg, png etc) via UI",pasquale [:dedalus],New,"","At this moment, there are various ways to change the official redmine logo with your company logo: generally you need to edit the application.css file or use node npm in the case of sass-based themes.

39713,Add technical identifier on some objects,Jérôme Gallot,New,"","Hi,

Actually Lot of objects in redmine had an id or a name (visible by users) but no reliable field between several redmine environnements (several database, several uses)

I work with several environnements with databases which are not synchronized (so ID are différents between them, and name can evolved et be different)

I need to synchonize parts of Redmine between environnements (always in the same way environnement A -> environnement B)

For me, it's not reliable to create my synchronization on an ID or a Name, i think we should have a technical name/identifier on the objects.

So what do you think of adding an identifier at least on those elements :

- custom fields
- trackers
- workflows
- -projects (already exists)
- roles

What do you think of this feature ?

We had a lot of customfields on our projects and we would appreciate to add more information on it.

There is a description but it only to be visualized by users.

We'd like to have a field like 'Comment' to add comment on custom field in order to add information of the context.

Exemple 1 : 2 custom fields witch same visible name (but one with 1 space in name), i'd like to specify the use of those fields
Exemple 2 : custom field are too short, the comment can help the administrator to best maintain this custom field

39530,Feature to Group Custom Fields by Category,philippe lhardy,New,Related to #35281,"Enhance custom fields with a category that will be used to group all custom fields within a single table/frame for a very same category at display.

39529,Add tooltips for clarifying non-notifiable user mentions,Mizuki ISHIKAWA,New,Related to #39528,"Currently, when a user without permission to view a particular issue is mentioned, they do not receive a notification email. However, visually, the mention link appears identical to others, which can be misleading as there's no indication that no email was sent.

In issue ##39528, I proposed changing the background color of mention links for such users to make it clear they are non-notifiable. However, I believe that visual change alone may not sufficiently convey the intent to users. Therefore, I suggest using tooltips to display a message clarifying the status of the mention.
Yet, since tooltips are only used for displaying title attributes right now, expanding their use might require some discussion, which is why I have created a separate ticket for this matter."
39528,Change mention link color for users without access to view issues,Mizuki ISHIKAWA,New,Related to #39529,"I propose a feature enhancement for better visibility regarding user permissions and mention notifications. Currently, when a user who does not have the permission to view a particular issue is mentioned, they do not receive a mention notification email. However, this is not visually apparent since the mention link looks identical to others, potentially leading to confusion over whether a notification was sent.

- *In issue Aa* (related to U1, U2): I set to Private then, change ' *Issues visibility* ' of U1, U2 to ' _All Issue_ '. Then U1, U2 can see Aa;
- After 3 days, another admin create Issue *Ab* and *Ac* with ' _Private_ ' activated and only want to show to U3, U4 so he have to change ' *Issues visibility* ' of U3, U4 to ' _All Issue_ '.

39160,"Add ""Statuses"" filter when creating new ""Issue"" custom fields",Zee Prime,Needs feedback,"","Custom fields on issues can be associated with specific Trackers, so a custom field that is associated with ""Bug"" will be hidden on issues of other types.  However, if that custom field is ""required"" then it is required for every status of that issue throughout its workflow.  

In many workflows, specific pieces of information are added to an issue throughout its workflow and not all at the beginning, so it would be most useful if custom fields could reflect this.  For example, in the workflow of a ""Bug"" when the tester sets the status to ""Verified"" that tester should note the version number that they tested and the environment that they tested it in.  If a user sets the bug to ""Rejected"" they should provide an explanation for why it is rejected.

Currently, we keep all of this information in ""Notes"" and it is the responsibility of each user to remember what needs to be added based on the status they're switching from/to.  However, if we could keep this in custom fields that are selectively shown at specific points in the workflow this would both better enforce compliance and would store that information in a more structured way that we could leverage better in custom queries and reports."

38853,do not disclose login account names (public projects disclose some user info),Thomas Meyer,New,"","As message#67884 did not get any reaction, I think it is worth submitting a ticket:

Following the message#51163 discussion:

We recently observed the fact that Redmine (at least until Remdmine 4.2) has the somewhat doubtable default setting that role 2 (anonymous) has the right to see all users and not only members of visible projects. I would say the latter would be a better default.

Furthermore, when there are public projects, all members of these projects are still visible to the public, together with their (login) account name, which is, in case of directory integration, their user name.

This clearly is an information that should not go to the public.

So I would suggest to

* not disclose redmine login account names to the public, even in public projects (this could probably be reached by adding a nick for public display)
* provide an option to add noindex directives to search bots for user and group information

38504,Display pasted images in appropriate size on HiDPI displays,Go MAEDA,New,"","The attached patch improves the image paste feature to display images in appropriate size when you use HiDPI displays like Mac's Retina Display.

If you capture a screenshot on a HiDPI display and paste it into Redmine, the image will be displayed at twice the expected size. The image below is an example. Although the expected display size of the image is 400 x 240px, it is actually displayed at 800 x 480px. This is because the image was captured on a HiDPI display and its physical size is 800 x 480px. For me, this problem is really annoying.

!{border: 1px solid grey;}.clipboard-202304301538-efqbd.png!

After applying the patch, Redmine recognizes the pixel density of the current display when pasting an image and adds an ""@2x"" or ""@3x"" suffix to the filename (e.g. clipboard-****@2x.png) depending on the recognized value of the pixel density. With the suffix, pasted images are displayed in an appropriate size. Note that Redmine 3.4.0 and later can recognize suffixes such as ""@2x"" and ""@3x"" and adjust the display size of the image (#24922).
 
I believe this change will improve the UX when using HiDPI displays by resolving the problem that images are displayed at more than twice the size.

The image in a forum post is displayed twice as large as expected.

38226,Implement cron endpoint or script to allow calling scheduled tasks,Echedey López Romero,New,"","Hi.

I am unsure where to classify this issue because it covers a wide range of uses.

Currently, I am managing some Redmine setups over Docker based on the https://github.com/docker-library/redmine image.

Several of these setups, make impossible determining in which node the instance will run or even controlling the service in order to program calls on cron requests in the nodes to perform scheduled tasks in the instances.

Things such as reminders don't work with this setup and, even when I performed a workaround (https://github.com/docker-library/redmine/issues/64#issuecomment-1303047095), this is not ideal for high availability, as it would finish running several @cron@ instances duplicating the issue and further complexity would be added beyond reasonable to fix that with yet another workaround.

It happens that Nextcloud has 3 ways to run its internal tasks:
* Via AJAX while loading the web interface
* Via external http call using some custom service such as easyCron or your own machine to an endpoint
* Via @cron@ in the same machine

So, given this situation, I am suggesting to implement some kind of endpoint to call and execute scheduled tasks via external http calls."

38175,remember OpenID login confirmation / continue OpenID login when not logged into redmine yet,n eeels,New,"","At osmocom.org, we have a gerrit.osmocom.org instance, where we use OpenID with our osmocom.org redmine to log in to gerrit.
The login sequence via OpenID can be extremely cumbersome, and i am seeing that every day, over and over again.
The worst case sequence I get on a daily basis is:

- on gerrit, click login (to comment on a patch for example)
- select osmocom.org as OpenID provider
- osmocom.org first wants me to log in (because i was previously not logged in)
- after login, i am not directed back to gerrit, but remain on osmocom.org redmine. other site's login procedure was aborted.
- pull up that gerrit link again -- am not logged in on gerrit yet.
- click gerrit login again
- now redmine asks me to confirm whether to share login with gerrit.osmocom.org. I have to click ""Yes"".
- only now am I logged in on gerrit.

This so much less convenient than a password manager in the browser that fills in user name and password, and i just hit enter and done.
However, our gerrit only allows OpenID login, so I am forever stuck with above sequence.

The above could improve in these two ways:

- When redmine is asked to provide an OpenID login for another site, do not drop that request when i am not logged in on redmine yet.
  So i.e. some other site requests OpenID login, then, if required, do first ask the user to log in on redmine,
  but then *continue* to complete the OpenID login on the other site.

- When I give redmine confirmation that it is ok to share the OpenID login with another site, provide a tick mark saying ""remember this choice"",
  so that i do not have to click ""Yes"" every day over again."

In general, it seems that you can assign a task (ie: go learn something)

Perhaps each Training item would or could be a separate Project

But - then there is expiration - ie: Every year you need to go through a refresh.
Example: Every year you need to complete a 1 hour sexual harassment training, managers have to complete a longer 2 hour one.

In the ticket filtering, the ""Comment Creation Date"" field allows you to specify a date for tickets with comments.
If the ticket filtering function can extract tickets that were created after the date of the comment, it would be more efficient for the administrator to check for tickets that have been responded to.

36711,Various features for MailHandler,Vincent Danjean,New,"","  Hi,

  For my local redmine instance (4.0.7-1~bpo10+1 from Debian package), I needed to improve the MailHandler behavior.
I'm sharing here my work in case it can be useful to others. Perhaps some modification might be added to official redmine, it is up to you.
I'm new in ruby, so do not hesitate to correct me if they are improvement that can be done.

  My patch add the following behaviors:

1) keep some headers in messages
  It occurs several time I've been missing some information present in the original mail. So, I added some functions to keep them (to, cc, bcc (and subject for replies))
  This is the part about headers_as_text and header_as_text
  It is my first try. All is hardcoded in the code (no option)

2) Allows one to specify the start of a line as a regexp when matching redmine keyword
  So, invoking redmine:email:receive_imap with reprefix='Redmine:? ?' forces redmine to only look at line starting with this motif (before all keywords such as Project: ...). This avoid false positive line in the mail...
  For this, there is a small modif to read the option from env and a small modif in extract_keyword! to add this prefix (and to use named match group as the prefix can add new groups '()')

3) And the biggest part: something that allows to answer to an issue without knowing the issue number.
  One of my initial goal was to be able to keep track of icinga problems in Redmine.
  Initially, I setup icinga to send notification to redmine. It works, but all messages creates new issues (either for new problems, but also for notification of fixed problem).
  So, redmine was having lots of issues, and manual work was required if we want to close issue correctly.
  I was difficult to do more things from icinga because icinga runs on a machine that cannot access to the web interface of redmine (no way for me to change this politic), so I cannot imagine icinga to look for the correct issue number (and I would not even know how to do this if the systems was on the same machine).

So, I imagine another idea. I use a specific custom field. Icinga sets up this field in all its mails, making unique by problem.
On redmine part, in the dispatch_to_default, before creating an issue, I first check if
a) the custom field is set
b) and an issue is opened with the custom field set to this value
If both conditions are present, I add a reply to the issue (instead of creating a new issue)

On redmine part, there is just an option to choose the custom field to use (ext_ref in my implementation)
On icinga, I added this kind of things in the message (it is prepared by a bash script):
<pre>
## Redmine links
cat << EOF
Redmine external reference: icinga-service: ${SERVICENAME}@${HOSTNAME}
Redmine machine: ${HOSTNAME}
Redmine service: ${SERVICENAME}
EOF
if [ ""$SERVICESTATE"" = OK ]; then echo ""Redmine Status: Terminé(e)""; fi
</pre>
  Machine and Service being to other custom fields in my tracker (and ""External Reference"" is the name of the custom field I'm using and that I give with the ext_ref='...' new parameter)

So now, new icinga problems creates new tickets. But futher notifications for the same problem (host/service) are added to the same redmine issue, until the problem is gone (""$SERVICESTATE"" = OK) that will close the ticket. If another problem occurs with the same host/service, a new ticket will be created. I a separate problem occurs with different host and/or service, another ticket will be used.

A few word about my code:
1) I'm not sure I correctly use IssueQuery. I do not find lots of examples (from ruby point of view) and I'm under the impression that the way I add the custom field filter (from its name and the searched value) is a hack.
2) I'm pretty sure that IssueQuery won't work with no_permission_check=1 (but again, I did not find any doc about the restriction on issues that IssueQuery return (visible to the current user?, ...?))
3) I needed to find a keyword (the custom field value) at the start, before the place where it will be extracted and write into the issue.
  With the initial implementation of get_keyword/extract_keyword!, the custom field value would be erased at the start, and not seen later when the issue must be updated.
  So I added a parameter to these to function that allows one to avoid to modify the message.
  It is not a proper code (extract_keyword! can be a method that do *not* modify the text, ...), it would probably need to be rewritten correctly.

And, for the end, an idea that I will perhaps implement (not yet done): two different options for allow_override: one used for new issues, one used when replying to an issue.

Even if these ideas are not added to core Redmine, I think they can be useful for other people. Having looked on Internet, I was not the only one trying to make icinga and redmine work together.
And this framework can (and will in my case) be use in other contexts:
- linking issues from redmine and another ticket system (just an idea for now, but it should be doable)
- allowing an external pipeline to create and update the good issue by mail (based on an external unique pipeline run ID)
- ...

36573,Extend config.ru to support sub-uri ootb and cleanup all wiki pages,Tiemo Vorschuetz,New,"","Hi folk,

Almost all of the solutions on the wiki pages are outdated and either never worked or don't work anymore with version 4.x as discussed several times. From my point of view, the only sensible way is to extend config.ru. This approach works as expected. Unfortunately, I have wasted days over past few years at this point trying to get Redmine working under a sub-URI. This even led to me losing almost all of my beautiful hair. And just as ugly as it makes me look now, is trying through all the possibilities enumerated over several wiki pages.

My suggestion: The config.ru should therefore look like this out-of-the-box:

<pre>
# This file is used by Rack-based servers to start the application.

require ::File.expand_path('../config/environment', __FILE__)
map ENV['REDMINE_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT'] || '/' do
    run RedmineApp::Application
end
</pre>

This can then be used to configure the Docker image by one variable, for example if you want to update a legacy system and can't reassign the uri because of backwards compatibility.

The config.ru would be usable unchanged with the default configuration and optionally for people who want or need to run redmine under a sub-URI.

Is there anything against changing the delivered config.ru in the codebase as mentioned above?

1. click to edit to open issue editions interface it self, and then
2. click in description editions specific button.

but more importantly this is unintuitive, confusing, as well as being ambigious,
because when someone intends to edit something in a issue they assume description editions would be included. Many times people just assume that one needs to be a administrator of the instance to do so, given the ""edit description"" feauture is a little bit not obvious.

SOLUTION
Separate the experience in two in the right upper corner, or by adding a feature/button for just the note section bellow the issue report:
editing -> refering to editions on description
commenting -> refering to further editions on ""notes"" section bellow issue report

> You have received this notification because you have either subscribed to it, or are involved in it.

This approach have several issues:
* the text can be removed by an admin
* the text is not translatable
* the text is too generic and the user cannot understand why he received that notification

My proposal is to replace this text with the real reason of why the user received the notification. In this phase, I propose the following reasons with the according translations:

| *Reason* | *Message* | *Details* |
| @INVOLVED@ | You have received this notification because you are involved in. | user is either author, assignee or previous assignee |
| @MENTIONED@ | You have received this notification because you have been mentioned in. | user in mentioned in that event |
| @SUBSCRIBED@ | You have received this notification because you have subscribed to it. | user is subscribed to that event |
| @WATCHER@ | You have received this notification because you are watching it. | user is a watcher |
| @ADMIN@ | You have received this security notification because you are an administrator. | user is an admin and he received a security notification |

In the future, we can add even a more granular reason for the involved reason: author, assignee or previous assignee.

Also, I propose to always display the text ""To change your notification preferences, please click here: %{link to my account}.""

Given the info above, currently:
* Textile attachment rendering always works, always relying on RedCloth3 (since RedCloth3 is bundled);
* Markdown attachment rendering +*only*+ works with one of the optional Markdown core formatters installed (relying on Redcarpet or CommonMark) and based on @Setting.text_formatting@.

Redmine should also provide support for (custom) third-party Textile and Markdown formatters (e.g. RedCloth4 [via a formatter like provided by e.g. ""redmine_redcloth"":/plugins/redmine_redcloth], kramdown, Maruku, RDiscount, etc.), based on what formatters (core and third-party) are actually available.

Yet, it's not possible to distinguish whether it is one or the other - at least not an easy one via the API.

Developers might have to perform additional requests to be API, in hopes of being able to determine if it's user reference or a group. This might not be as easy as it sounds. You only have the name to match against, which depending on display setting, a user's name will be outputted differently in the reference, making it a bit frustrating attempting to compare against.

35796,Allow subject and priority issue attributes (i.e. tracker fields) to be disablable,Mischa The Evil,New,Related to #38416,"I see many use-cases where items which are tracked as Redmine issues lack a priority and/or a subject. They could e.g. lack both a priority and a subject altogether or lack a priority and substitute the subject attribute with a title or name attribute in the form of a custom field.

I think it would be great if Redmine could support such configurations without the need for users/admins to resort to (custom) workarounds. That way, the bare minimum of issue attributes would consist of only the status attribute (by disabling all the fields in the tracker config combined with setting the remaining fields to read-only in the workflow field permissions).

Use-case examples:
* collection management (books/movies/CDs/DVDs/BDs/recipes, etc.)
* (software) license management
* inventory management
* contact management
* vacation-/presence management
* appointment management
* etc.

In the case that such entities are tracked as Redmine issues, an administrator can already modify/override the respective Redmine core translations easily via a plugin to globally rename 'issues' into a more general term like 'items'.

will invoke the _:model_changeset_scan_commit_for_issue_ids_pre_issue_update_ hook also if there was just the 'refs' keyword used.

Well, is there a reason to call this hook only in case an issue was changed to 'fixed'?"
35679,Ignore text email parts only stating that the email should be viewed as HTML,Felix Schäfer,New,Related to #34974,"As already discussed in #30838 some emails now contain ""Your email client does not support HTML messages."" in the text part and the interesting bits in the HTML part. This can be solved with the ""prefer HTML"" setting introduced in #30838.

We would like to propose a patch to still ignore email text parts stating ""Your email client does not support HTML messages."" or similar with a blacklist. This way users preferring text parts and/or not aware of the new option do not need to see those parts in Redmine."

35663,Access custom fields in project specific activities via Redmine API,Simeon Trifonov,New,"","I created a custom field in the activities that should contain different code for each activity. Also the codes could be different in the different projects. This is supported from Redmine and works fine.

I tried to access this data from outside (using Python-Redmin library) and it seems to be impossible. The developers of the library said that this is not supported from the Redmine API and they cannot solve this problem. I will appreciate extension of the Redmine API that will allow access to custom fields in the activities."
35657,Spent time ratio column and filter,Go MAEDA,New,"","I suggest adding a new column and a new filter to the issues list.

The name of the column and the filter is ""Spent time ratio"". ""Spent time ratio"" column displays the percentage of a spent time divided by an estimated time. The column is useful to see the sign of overspending of man-hours and find issues that took more time than estimated.

""Easy Redmine"":https://www.easyredmine.com/ already has the same column and filter.

35645,Request for reconsideration of removal of 'View all issues' link,Mischa The Evil,New,Related to #30294,"Yesterday I started doing some development work on Redmine again. The first thing that I stumbled upon was that the 'View all issues' link in the issues sidebar was removed in r18304. Although I see the merit of its removal with #30294, it really annoys me not having that link available (to such an extend that I quickly created a ""small plugin"":/plugins/redmine_add_all_issues_link_in_issues_sidebar to restore it on the issues show view).
The reason for this annoyance is that it was the only way to clear the current, not-saved query straight from the issues show view without first going back to the issues index view and then subsequently clicking on the clear button. With the link on issues show it is possible to go back to the default issues list without the need of an additional click on the clear button to clear the in-memory query. All the other (currently available) links that go back to the issues index view (project menu and query links on the index show view) retain the current query.

So, to make a long story short, I'd like to request a reconsideration of the decision for the removal of this link. This is also rooted in the fact that I think more (power) users will be/have been bitten by this change.

FTR:
* I have no problems with the move of the other links ('Summary' and 'Import') to the drop-down menu. This request is just about the 'View all issues' link.
* I haven't looked into the changes of the 'Spent time' sidebar yet, but the points of the 'Issues sidebar' might also apply to those views.
* If the removal decision is indeed reverted then it would be viable to subsequently also revert the addition of the clear query buttons added in #31640, as they would become obsolete if the 'View all issues' link is added back in.
* I am also ok if my request will be declined. I'll then just keep using my plugin to restore the old situation...
