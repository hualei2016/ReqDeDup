10091,Allow administrator to permanently disable modules,Declan Lynch,New,Is duplicate of #41143,"In our environment we do not have any need for the gantt charts or calendar modules.

While the administrator can specify which modules should be enabled by default on new projects, the project owner can elect to enable other modules also.

It would be nice to give the administrator the ability to enable/disable modules from ever being used in any project so if the administrator was to disable the calendar module or the time tracking module in the overall application settings the modules would not even show up as options for new projects or in the project settings. Projects that may already have the modules enabled would also no longer display the disabled modules."

Projects want to integrate bug breportimng and feature request form in their web apps, using rest api to sumbit new issues. 
The users in all apps (redmine and other apps) use same ldap and so far the user data are the same. If using rest api don't know the api key of the user in which name the app wanna submit the issue, but the issue indeed shall show this user name a author. I tried to set author and update author after the issue was created via rest call. But the author always is and stays as the user which the api keys belongs. I think the cause is ""this line"":
/projects/redmine/repository/revisions/3310/entry/trunk/app/controllers/issues_controller.rb#L140

The only way to offer this 3rd party web form integration without loosing author information of submitter will need to enable to change the author by a third person. This will need a right to be in a role and then the rest api shall also provide to set the author name.

30998,Add an rake task to prune registered users after a certain number of days,David Demelier,Closed,Is duplicate of #38541,"Hello,

Unfortunately I'm not enough skilled in ruby to propose a patch.

Like many other people, I'm affected by spammers that half-register themselves but do not complete inscriptions due their fake emails. So I constantly have a pile of half-registered users that pollute my database.

It could be nice if there was an option to automatically delete accounts that were not successfully registered after a given amount of time (example, 1 day by default or something like that).

What do you think?"
39500,"Change the default notification option for users to ""Only for things I watch or I am assigned to""",Go MAEDA,Closed,Is duplicate of #38343,"Currently, the default notification option for a new user is *""Only for things I watch or I'm involved in""* (internal_name: only_my_events) . This sends notifications when any of the following conditions are met.

* The issue/object is *watched* by the user
* The issue is *created* by the user
* The issue is *assigned* to the user

I think the default option should now be *""Only for things I watch or I am assigned to""* (internal name: only_assigned) which sends notifications when any of the following conditions are met.

* The issue/object is *watched* by the user
* The issue is *assigned* to the user

This is because Redmine 5.1.0 has an auto watch for newly created issues (#38238) and the option is enabled by default for newly created users, and the behavior of the combination of auto watch and only_my_events is somewhat confusing.

Consider the following scenario:

# Admin creates a new user. The user has all auto watches enabled by default, and the email notification option is set to only_my_events
# The user creates an issue. Since all auto watches are enabled for the user, they are added as a watcher
# The user receives notifications about the issue
# The user decides they do not want to receive notifications anymore and unwatches the issue
# But the user still receives notifications because the notification option is only_my_events, and they are the author of the issue

If the default notification option is changed from only_my_events to only_assigned, this confusion will be eliminated. Here is a scenario in this case:

# Admin creates a new user. The user has all auto watches enabled by default, and the email notification option is set to only_assigned
# The user creates an issue. Since all auto watches are enabled for the user, they are added as a watcher
# The user receives notifications about the issue
# The user decides they do not want to receive notifications anymore and unwatches the issue
# The user does not receive notifications anymore because the notification option is only_assigned, and they are no longer a watcher

As illustrated above, in Redmine 5.1, the behavior is more understandable if the notification option defaults to only_assigned."
17689,De-List or cleraly mark commercial plugins,Jan Niggemann (redmine.org team member),New,"Is duplicate of #18664, Is duplicate of #19882, Is duplicate of #38255","I keep getting complaints by mail about easyredmine non-free plugins in our directory and there are similar complaints on the forums (message#37931).

22483,Show PDF attachments and repo entries instead of downloading them,Gregor Schmidt,Needs feedback,"Is duplicate of #22098, Is duplicate of #36504","Following up on #22058, I would like to propose, that also PDF files are shown directly instead of forcing downloads.

This applies to two use cases:

h3. 1. Following a download link

When following a download link, image are sent with @content-disposition: inline@, while all other files are sent with @attachment@. Since the some browsers is able to render PDF files directly (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, IE with Adobe Reader installed) and people are probably used to it, I think that extending this exception to PDF files is a reasonable change. If native PDF rendering within the browser is not supported, then a download will be initiated by the browser anyway.

h3. 2. Displaying a PDF file in repository browser

When accessing ""View"" within the file view in the repository browsers, Redmine currently forces a download of the PDF. Instead an iframe could be rendered which displays the PDF within the Redmine UI. Browser support for this use case is similar to No. 1.


-------

The patch series is based on current trunk (r15332) plus the changes of #22482. If desired, I could isolate the changes further, to make them work without #22482.

h3. @0004-Don-t-force-download-of-PDFs-but-show-in-browser-pre.patch@

The change updates @AttachmentsController@ and @RepositoryController@ to send PDF files with @content-disposition: inline@. (See first use case.)

h3. @0005-Show-pdf-preview-for-repository-files-and-attachment.patch@

The change adds @attachments/pdf@ and @common/_pdf@ views to render PDF files in an iframe/object construct. (See second use case.)

Since we cannot easily know the PDF’s dimensions, the frame size follows the following rules:

* it is as wide as possible (100%)
* in general it is as high as it is wide
* it is never higher than 80 % of the viewport (80vh), since we want to make sure, that there is always a bit of Redmine UI visible to avoid getting “trapped” within the frame

Using a nested object/iframe structure was taken from http://pdfobject.com/static.html"

* some people may not like to be *forced to resign from their privacy*. When user is forced to provide data he does not want to, he will probably provide fake data. Value of fake data is not greater that that of no data. This is related to #28106.
* there is already option in Redmine to set *user display format to login only* (instead of first/last name).
* some jurisdictions may require sites that *gather personal data to comply with specific laws*. Again if Redmine is used by open source project communities it may place an unnecessary burden on site administrators.
* some communities largely make *use of only one name* and requiring 2 names is requiring impossible. Related: #1595

The problem is the owner of the issues, until Redmine 1.3 the owner of the issues of the template was copied to the new project, since 1.4 the owner is the one who copied the project.
This two options have their problems.
My suggestion is to have a combo in the copy project window , that the user can choose who will be the owner of the issues and etc... of the new project."

This is quite useful since it is nice and simple to just get the full response in a single page rather than having to traverse pagination, and a limit of a bit more than 100 is still very performant for many sites -- the limit beyond which performance starts to degrade really depends on the particular site's usage, so should be controllable by the local administrator.

28198,Support issue relations when importing issues,Gregor Schmidt,Closed,Is duplicate of #33330,"As promised in #22701, I now would like to propose a patch, which adds handling of issue relations to the CSV importer.

h3. Usage

The attached patch extends the import configuration view with a new block, so that users may select a column for each relation type. The parent issue field also moved to the new block, since it's conceptually related.

Within the CSV file the columns may define multiple relations of the same type, each separated with @,@. Related issues follow the same rules as parent issues. A string preceded with a @#@ is supposed to be an existing issue. Without the @#@ it's supposed to be another row within the import file. For _follows_ and _precedes_ relations an additional delay may be present, e.g. @#12 3d@ specifying a relation to issue @#12@ and a delay of 3 days.

h3. Technical notes

Since issue relations may only be created when the issue was already saved, I've added a second step to the import. Additionally to @build_object@, which needs to be implemented by @Import@ sub classes, there's also a @extend_object@ method now. This is used by the @IssueImporter@ to save the relations after the issue was already saved successfully.


h3. Additional considerations

Initially, I wanted to build the import, so that issue relations exported from Redmine could be imported directly. But the format that's used by the exporter was designed for humans, not so much for computers. Most importantly, to parse this format we would need to grep for the localized relation names, which might even change between versions of Redmine. Therefore I settled for the proposed approach of having separate columns for each relation type."

26791,Send individual notification mails per mail recipient,Holger Just,Closed,"Is duplicate of #4231, Is duplicate of #11981, Is duplicate of #32291","With this patch series, we are introducing the general concept to send multiple mails per notification event. Specifically, we are sending one mail per recipient user. Each of those mails is rendered in the context of the recipient (i.e. with @User.current@ set to the recipient). The mails can be sent immediately or optionally delayed using ActiveJob.

This approach has a couple of advantages over the existing approach of sending a single mail to multiple recipients:

* We ensure object visibility for the rendered mails in the most generic way. Since each mail is rendered with @User.current@ set to the recipient, all content rendered in the mail (including shown issue attributes, macros and links in rendered textile text, ...) is guaranteed to only be visible to the user without having to ensure this manually for each mail using the same visibility rules as used for the HTML views already.
* The mail will always be sent in the recipients language, even if multiple users with different languages are notified
* There is no risk of the whole notification mail being rejected because of a single invalid recipient address (see #8157, #6829, #8733 and a lot of duplicates)

In the long run, it will also allow us to introduce user-specific additional information in the rendered notification, e.g. related issues, links to assign the issue, ...

With this new approach, we do have a some challenges which we are trying to address separately:

* Since each mail is always rendered with an adapted @User.current@, any mail views which expected to use the original @User.current@ need to be adapted. In Redmine core, this only affects the security notifications.
* Depending on the number of recipients for a notification, there might be many rendered mails which can take some time in the request. To ensure a snappy response, we can use ActiveJob to render and send the mails in the background. This can make the @async_*@ delivery methods obsolete.

h2. Reminder: How mail sending works in plain Rails (and Redmine)

This patch series changes how mails are generated and delivered. Let's first look at how a mail normally gets generated and delivered in ActionMailer.

* @mail = Mailer.news_added(news)@ - The user calls a class-method of the Mailer class (a child-class of ActionMailer::Base). This method is usually not implemented in the @Mailer@ class itself. Instead, there is a ""@method_missing@"":https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v5.1.2/actionmailer/lib/action_mailer/base.rb#L576-L582 method on @ActionMailer::Base@. Here, ActionMailer creates a @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object. Which is basically a delegator to an _eventually rendered_ mail object. Now, the mail is not actually rendered here. The @MessageDelivery@ object only collects all arguments it needs to eventually render the mail. This happens implicitly when any method on the mail is accessed (e.g. when the mail is about to be delivered). The @MessageDelivery@ delegator is returned to the user.

Now that we have the (delegated) mail, we can deliver it with @mail.deliver@. This method used to be the only delivery method. With newer Rails versions, there is (with some variations) @deliver_now@ and @deliver_later@. Redmine usually calls @deliver@ which in source:trunk/config/initializers/10-patches.rb#L160 calls @deliver_now@ currently.

When calling @mail.deliver@, the delegator starts to render the mail:

* ""@MessageDelivery#processed_mailer@"":https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v5.1.3/actionmailer/lib/action_mailer/message_delivery.rb#L103-L107 creates a new @Mailer@ instance and calls @process@ on it.
* @Mailer#process(:news_added, news)@ - The @process@ method is part of ActionMailer (and in turn part of the @ActionController@ framework on which ActionMailer is based on). Among things, it calls the specified action, i.e. the instance method.
* @Mailer#news_added(news)@ - This instance method is implemented on the Mailer class and is responsible to render the actual mail message. Here, we set headers, instance variables for the view and basically do the usual controller stuff. With a final call to @mail@, we eventually render a single mail and return a @Mail::Message@ object.
* This returned @Mail::Message@ object is delivered with a call to @Mail::Message#deliver_now@.

h2. How we hook into this process

Now, in order to send multiple mails, we hook into this process to render (and deliver) multiple mails. We want to ensure two things:

* We want to create multiple mails, one per recipient and deliver them all in one go.
* When rendering the mail (i.e. when calling the Mailer's instance method), we want to set @User.current@ to the recipient user and set it back to the original value after the rendering is done

These two goals are achieved with two specific changes to our Mailer:

We introduce a wrapper class called @Mailer::MultiMessage@. Instances of this class wrap multiple @Mail::Message@ objects (or rather @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ objects which delegate to @Mail::Message@ objects). The class provides the same @deliver_*@ methods as the original @Mail::Message@ objects. When calling such a method, we are calling it on each of the wrapped messages. This allows us to use an instance of this class in place of a @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object.

We use this class by implementing _class methods_ for each mailer action. These class methods implement the same external interface (i.e. accept the same arguments) as the old instance methods. This ensures that we keep the existing public interface. The class methods fetch the recipient users for the respective object (i.e. the issue, news, comment, ...). We use @Mailer::MultiMessage#for@ to add an @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object for each recipient which eventually renders the mail.

When creating the delegator, we also pass the recipient user to the arguments for the mail rendering. We use this user in the overwritten @Mailer#process@ method to set @User.current@ and their language before actually rendering the message. This convention allows us to keep the interfaces clear: the user is only passed between the class method and @Mailer#process@ but doesn't need to be specified on the instance action. Here, it is already set as @User.current@ for each rendered mail.

We also extend @Mailer.method_missing@ (on the class) to create a single-mail @Mailer::MultiMessage@ object with the current user in case the class method for an action is not explicitly overwritten. This ensures that our convention of always passing a user to @Mailer#process@ is kept up even if a plugin only adds an instance method (which was valid before).

h2. What we tried and did not work

I first attempted to set the current user directly in the action's class method. and reset it directly afterwards. That would have made the code much more localized. However, due to the delayed rendering of the mail with the @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object, the mail will be rendered only after we have already reset the current user.

One way to work around this would be to introduce @deliver_*@ methods (like the now obsolete @Mailer.deliver_issue_add@ method). However doing so would have changed the intended external interface of our @Mailer@ class and would likely lead to integration pain with all existing Redmine plugins sending mail.

h2. What we ship

We ship three patches here:

* @0001-Send-individual-emails-for-each-mail-recipient.patch@ - The main implementation including tests.
* @0002-Cleanup-Remove-Issue-each_notification-and-Journal-e.patch@ - Removes unneccessary methods for grouping recipients based on custom field visibility
* @0003-Optional-Ensure-that-ActiveRecord-Base-objects-are-f.patch@ - An optional patch which changes the serialization behavior when sending mails with ActiveJob (e.g. with @Mailer.news_added(news).deliver_later@). By default, Rails serialized the arguments as a globalid (which is basically a reference to the object in the database identified by its ID). If there are concurrent changes to e.g. a newly created issue, this might result in notifications using the new state instead of the original state. With this patch, we serialize the exact attributes of the given objects into the job. Since this also causes nested attributes to be serialized along, care must be taken to avoid reference errors. In general, we should probably try to use mostly immutable state in the database where it is an important consideration that the notification state is exactly shown in the DB.

h2. Future work

h3. ActiveJob sending

If the general direction of this patch is accepted, it is probably desireable to move the mail sending to ActiveJob completely. This could replace the @async_*@ delivery methods [[EmailConfiguration#Asynchronous-delivery_methods|currently configurable]] in @configuration.yml@. This change can either be hardcoded in source:trunk/config/initializers/10-patches.rb#L160 or made configurable with a setting. I'll be glad to provide a patch for this. It would only be a few lines of code.

By default, we could use the in-process ActiveJob runner to send mails. More advanced users with a dedicated job worker (e.g. delayed job) can easily switch to that without changes to the Redmine code itself.

h3. BCC recipients

Since each user gets their own mail, we can probably remove the setting to send mails with BCC completely. If plugins want to send mails to non-user recipients, we would have to make sure to either set the recipients manually on BCC or group them appropriately. It is not a required setting in Redmine core anymore though."

13307,Start date and due date in email notifications,Benjamin Jeanjean,Closed,Is duplicate of #29254,"Today, the start date and the due date doesn't appears in the email sent when we create a new issue.
It would be really useful to make them appears for being aware of the priority of the issue."
3097,Add CSV export to Gantt,Maxim Krušina,New,Is duplicate of #29212,Then it can be converted to Excel file for further reporting to clients
18006,Project's custom fields should be available in issue lists columns,Stéphane Dubois,Resolved,"Is duplicate of #19094, Is duplicate of #29131","In an issue list, it is possible to filter by Project custom field but it is not possible to display those project custom fields in the issue list (fields not present in Options/Available columns)"
1385,Script for import from JIRA,Charles L,New,Is duplicate of #29097,"I've attached ""migrate_from_jira.rake"", which was modeled on both the trac migration script, and jira2trac.rb which can be found at trac's home page.

Though it isn't as polished as it could be, it gives better fidelity than jira2trac.rb + migrate_from_trac.rake, and hopefully it servers as a good starting point for any other tweaks needed to do a decent import.

It currently takes as input (as per jira2trac.rb), an xml dump of issue info from jira. Based on that, it imports projects, sub-projects, users, issue categories, issues, and issue comments."
26655,Additional icon for contextmenu,Felix Gliesche,Closed,"Is duplicate of #1590, Is duplicate of #5739, Is duplicate of #29074","The contextmenu is a very helpful feature that can increase the productivity while working with redmine. Many people don't know of this great feature because it is only triggered by a right mouse click, which is not a common user interaction on the web. In order to make this feature more prominent this patch adds an icon to table rows that have a contextmenu, which allows to trigger the appearance of the contextmenu with a regular mouse click. 

As there was no icon with three dots available in the famfamfam available, we created our own by using an existing icon with a dot.

This gif shows this new icon in action on the issues table:

!contextmenu.gif!"
5535,Assigned to issuelist filter: added <nobody> value,Radek Antoniuk,New,Is duplicate of #28924,"the filter in the issue list should list <nobody> as well, to make it possible to filter out issues that are assigned to user X OR not assigned at all
"
9122,Tracking adding/removal of watchers in the ticket history,Kirill Vasiliev,New,"Is duplicate of #10230, Is duplicate of #11213, Is duplicate of #28913",It should be possible to track adding and removal of watchers in the ticket history (mainly because of possibility to remove watcher after ticket was closed).
27090,Show the number of attachments on wiki pages,Tomomi Yuzuriha,Closed,Is duplicate of #28893,"I noticed the problem that users cannot know whether there are any attachments unless users expand the ""File"" section by clicking it.

9309,Add description field to custom queries,Anonymous,Closed,"Is duplicate of #28533, Is duplicate of #39047","Especially for public queries, it would be really useful to provide a simple description field where one could describe what the query displays and what it's used for."
26662,Add border around issue history to prevent accidental deletion of an issue,Go MAEDA,Closed,Is duplicate of #28514,"In my observation, some users accidentally delete an issue trying to delete last note. The misoperation is probably caused by the current UI of Redmine. The delete button at the bottom of IssuesController#show page looks as if it is a button for delete the last note, but actually it is a button to deletes the issue.

Such misoperation can be prevented by making a slight change to UI. Please see the following screenshots. By adding border around issue history, it becomes clear that the button is not a button for deleting the note. Our company have succeeded in significantly reducing accidents that our customers mistakenly delete an issue by implementing the change.

The patch was extracted from ""farend basic"":https://github.com/farend/redmine_theme_farend_basic theme.

26853,Fix hardcoded project-index width for webkit and mozilla browsers,Ilya Malahovskiy,Closed,"Is duplicate of #27174, Is duplicate of #27399, Is duplicate of #27556, Is duplicate of #27558, Is duplicate of #28005, Is duplicate of #28473, Is duplicate of #28122",
8629,Allow assigning issues and/or watcher status to authenticated non members,Paul Wilson,New,Is duplicate of #28405,"This feature request is vaguely similar to #7342 but that issue doesn't particularly fulfill this request.

Our redmine installation is configured to require authentication for access and for manual account activation for self registered accounts.

Since we require authentication for access, most projects on this system are configured as public and the Non member role set to permit view access and edit to forum, issue tracking, wiki, etc. This was done to allow all within the organization to have limited access to all public projects and was working as expected.

But while the majority of the activity within a project is accomplished by the active members of the project team who are all assigned to the project and associated with some role, it is not uncommon for an issue to require action by someone who is not a direct member of the team however, unless a user is actually a member of a project, as Non members they cannot be assigned tasks or designated as watchers.

As a work around, we have an 'Associated' role cloned from the Non member role and an 'Authenticated User' group that includes all (authenticated) users. This Authenticated user group is assigned to every public project with the 'Associated' role but as the number of workflow permutations is a function trackers X roles, a new role requires configuring (and maintaining) an additional workflow for each tracker.

This work around gives us the results we need but it also requires an additional step to ensure each user gets put into the 'Authenticated user' group.

While this work around is more or less acceptable, it would be friendlier if the issue Assignee selection list on the New Issue view and the add watcher list on the update issue view could be sorted and grouped by roles. Or better yet, sorted by roles and have the roles expandable/collapsable! Also, the issue Watcher list on the New Issue view would also be more friendly if it also were a select list as on the update issue view or at least expandable/collapsable as described above.

8488,Create an 'Involve' mechanism to private issues,Bruno Medeiros,New,"Is duplicate of #9330, Is duplicate of #10173, Is duplicate of #12584, Is duplicate of #11718, Is duplicate of #13828, Is duplicate of #14318, Is duplicate of #27028, Is duplicate of #27677, Is duplicate of #28368, Is duplicate of #29911, Is duplicate of #13512","As requested by some people (#7414#note-16, #7412#note-3, and so on), sometimes we need to involve someone that cannot access an issue by ""default rules"". It can happen, for example, when a customer send a problem via email and we need to create a Redmine issue ourself, and give this customer access to the ticket.

I asked Jean-Phillipe on #7412#note-2 to extend the visibility of an issue to observers, and some people liked it, but it was not done because observe mechanism was designed for notification purposes (I now I agree it is not good, that's why I'm creating this feature request).

So my request is:
Create a involve mechanism where some roles can add people in an issue, in a very similar way they add an observer, and the added users have access to the issue the were involved."
1737,autowatch issues,colin moock,Closed,Is duplicate of #28312,"i'd very much like to have a feature similar to Patch #222. that is, a per-user option to:

* ""auto-watch issues i've modified"" (i.e., autowatch if i create or modify an issue)
* ""auto-watch issues assigned to me""

Unlike Balazs (author of Patch #222), i'd want users to be able to choose their own ""autowatch"" policy.

Other than Patch #222, I couldn't find any other mention of this feature. Are there plans to implement it?"

This patch changes that so the previously entered date is preserved as well."
4569,Cannot add new version if all versions are closed (from issues page),Nick Fitzgerald,New,"Is duplicate of #13838, Is duplicate of #27920","With feature #4315 new versions can be added from the issues page. However, if all of the existing versions are closed, the Target version field does not appear and therefore this feature is not available. It would be nice for this option to be available, otherwise it defeats the purpose of this change."
26534,Allow project bulk edit of time entries,Marius BĂLTEANU,Closed,Is duplicate of #27879,"This issue follows #588#note-28 and adds the project field to bulk edit mode for time entries.

- Activity field is updated on project change (actually, the entire form is replaced on project change)
- Issue autocomplete is available only for bulk editing of time entries from the same project
- Added the ""Clear"" checkbox to the issue field.
- Moved the method ""bulk_edit_error_messages"" from issues_helper to application_helper because now it is used by both entities (issue and time entry)."

This is quite useful since it is nice and simple to just get the full response in a single page rather than having to traverse pagination, and a limit of a bit more than 100 is still very performant for many sites -- the limit beyond which performance starts to degrade really depends on the particular site's usage, so should be controllable by the local administrator.

ideally - provide a pre-configured test database instance,
then set some settings like ""authentication required"" and run tests with it.
then turn this setting OFF and run the tests again.

* ""authentication required""
* provide database settings on Redmine startup (ideally would be if Redmine supported in-memory database like Atlassian Jira)

23448,Allow updating existing issues via CSV import when their ID's are the same,Xavier Godon,New,"Is duplicate of #25810, Is duplicate of #28202, Is duplicate of #31830, Is duplicate of #32496","I'd like to have the possibility to update issues with a csv import.
Atm, if i import a task with an already existing ID, the ID changes and a new task is created."
22701,Allow forward reference to parent when importing issues,Gregor Schmidt,Closed,Is duplicate of #25799,"When importing issues via CSV with parent relations, the parent issues need to be positioned before child issues. Otherwise the relation will be ignored.

To work around this limitation, the issue import could be extended to use multiple passes:

# one to import basic issue properties
# one to import relations to other issues

This way it becomes easier to create the CSV files for imports, since order is no longer important.

This change would also be a prerequisite to import general issue relations. Since those cannot be more complex that parent relations and cannot necessarily be linearized properly.



Attached you find a patch series based on trunk r15361.

While implemented the changes, I tried to keep the @Import@ free from issue related information. Other existing @Import@ sub classes - within plugins e.g. - should need as little updates as possible.


h3. 0001 Extend test data for issue import

This change adds two rows to the existing issue import fixture file. These rows contain a parent and a child issue, while the parent is placed after the child. This would not import properly given the current implementation.

The patch also updates the existing tests, where the number of imported issues is asserted.

h3. 0002 Add test for issue relations to following rows

This patch extends the existing parent issue import test to also verify that the newly introduced parent child relation is properly imported. This test fails with the current implementation.

h3. 0003 Multi-pass CSV import

This patch defines a @required_passes@ method within @Import@ which returns @1@ by default and may be overwritten in sub classes. The @IssueImport@ does so and returns @1@ if no @parent_id@ mapping was set, otherwise it returns @2@.

The @run@ method is split into @run@ and @run_pass@. The first one is recursive and called once for each pass. It also handles the @max_*@ options. The second is only responsible for reading the rows, creating or updating the ImportItems and passing everything to @build_object@.

Since @build_object@ may now be called multiple times (once for each pass), the argument list was extended to provide more context. If somebody created a custom import in a plugin, this would need to be changed by the plugin's author.

In the @IssueImport@, @build_object@ is now split into @build_issue@ and @build_relations@, the first is called in the first pass, the second in pass 2.

The patch also contains a migration, which adds a @completed_passes@ field to @ImportItem@. This is needed to properly (re-)store progress for multi-step imports, like the ones via the web UI.

Finally the patch adds some test to make sure, that the general behavior of multi-step imports did not change with the introduction of multi-pass imports.


*Disclaimer*: I know, this is a rather large change to fix a minor nuisance. But as mentioned earlier, I think, this change is a necessary prerequisite to support importing ""Related Issues"" properly, which I would like to contribute next, if this patch is accepted."
18027,Notification when deleting an issue,claude g,New,"Is duplicate of #18271, Is duplicate of #25779","Currently, issue deleted are ... deleted :-)
To avoid to lost something, it would be great to have a final notification (same notifications rules + Redmine administrators). This notification should have the full history instead of final deletion step. I don't know how to handle attachments (attached or not - not so important).

24611,Plugin installer on the Administration page,Brian Rose,New,Is duplicate of #25776,"I am having a hell of a time installing a plugin - specifically ""Checklists"" which is the top rated plugin. I am doing this to evaluate the plugin installation process, but I am having no luck. 

First, some background.

I am not a ruby, or even a web developer. I write embedded code, and I would like to use Redmine to help manage my projects. I have some linux skills, but am a long way from being a guru.

I installed Redmine on an Ubuntu 16.04, Apache, and MySQL system using ""sudo apt-get"". For me, this was the easiest, most consistent way to resolve all dependencies and get a basic working system up and running. Trying to resolve all the discrepancies between the various installation instructions in the Guide drove me to madness. I finally found some installation instructions on the Ubuntu help pages that delivered a working system.

Now that it is installed, I cannot seem to get plugins working. I believe this is due to permissions. Since the system was installed with ""sudo apt-get install ..."" the files have root permissions. If I try to run the various commands indicated in the various plugin guides I usually get errors regarding permissions. (I am repeating my journey to madness trying to resolve all the unexplained differences) . If I try to run the commands with sudo, I get errors or warnings about running as root. In most cases I end up with a broken system. I have not figured out the magical incantation to install this plugin yet.

The feature request I have is to have an Administration page where you could upload the zip file, and it would install the plug-in to the appropriate directory, backup the appropriate files (as needed), run the appropriate commands with the appropriate credentials, and deliver a working system at the end.

I think this would help make this system a lot more usable to non-ruby developers."
7774,Sub groups or Multi-level groups,Jos Accapadi,New,"Is duplicate of #20228, Is duplicate of #25768","Did a preliminary search, but did not find a feature request for this.

As an example, we may have a marketing group, who has a web unit as part of it.  In some projects it would be good to assign the whole marketing group to see a project, and in some it would be just beneficial to do the web unit or sub group.

This would eliminate the need for duplicate entry of names into different groups.

31859,Per role visibility settings for spent time custom fields,Marius BĂLTEANU,Closed,Is duplicate of #25746,"Based on the work made by Jens Krämer in #23997, I've created a patch that adds role visibility settings for spent time custom fields (including two tests).

"
28234,Add CSV Import for Time Entries,Gregor Schmidt,Closed,Is duplicate of #25578,"h3. Preface

The imports controller was obviously built to be used for more than just issue imports. But since Redmine currently only supports issue imports, there are now some places, where assumptions about the issue import are hard-coded.

There are some plugins out there, which add other kinds of CSV imports to Redmine, but none of them seems to use the imports controller. I assume, it's because of the shortcomings mentioned above. I wanted to improve this situation, so I decided to build a time entry importer and - along the way - generalize the imports controller so that it's able to handle more than just issues.

h3. Preparations

The first patch attached extracts the issue related view parts into partials which are determined by convention. They are all prefixed with the imported model name, i.e. @_issues@. 

The issue related model parts are moved to the import model. Those are, e.g. the proper menu item, the authorization or the layout. Strictly speaking they should be located on the controller level, but I did not want to build sub classes of the imports controller for each and every kind of import.

h3. Adding the time entry import

The second patch attached adds the time entry import. It's using the newly introduced extension points to fill in the blanks. To provide a way for the user to find the new import, I've added the @timelog/_sidebar@ partial, similar to the one for issues. This new sidebar partial is now used in the timelog views and it contains a link to the import.

*Note:* within said partial, I've mis/re-used an i18n key @label_time_entries_visibility_all@ since it was providing the desired text in German and English. I did not want to introduce a new key based on the existing one, since that would have probably caused major merge problems. If desired, I may of course do that anyway.

h3. Closing notes

The second patch may of course also become a plugin. The main point of this patch (series) was it, to allow plugins to reuse the existing plugin infrastructure. Without the first patch though, a plugin author would need copy most of the views and functionality of the imports class, which is undesirable (at least for the plugin author).

Thank you for considering these patches."

7997,Merge Issues,Brian Lacy,New,Is duplicate of #25300,"Feature Request: Merge related issues

The idea would be to create a ""Merge Issue"" link next to the ""Duplicate"" and ""Delete"" links when viewing or updating Issues. Clicking it presents a box allowing you to enter an Issue number to merge with. Merging two issues combines all the comments and status updates chronologically (and of course presents an option to re-edit the title of the newly combined issue).

This would be super helpful! Sometimes issues are entered as separate tickets, when in fact they are the same or merely different aspects/perspectives on the same task. We don't want to just delete or close one of them, because they often contain useful comments relating to that particular aspect of the same task. Sorting through all the duplicate issues is a huge pain, but merging the issues would solve this problem."

23215,Add the possibility to filter issues after Target Version's Status and Due Date,Marius BĂLTEANU,Closed,"Is duplicate of #23855, Is duplicate of #20197, Is duplicate of #14164","Currently, we have the possibility to filter issues only after target version name and target version's custom fields (that have the ""Used as a filter"" checked). 

It'll very helpful to have the possibility to filter after target version status (open/locked/closed) and target version due date (effective_date). With these 2 new filters you can cover most of the use cases related to target version. 
Some examples:
- a query that returns all the issues that are assigned in open versions
- a query that returns all the issues that are assigned in versions with due date

The attached patch:
- implements these new 2 filters
- groups the target version status and target version due date with target version's custom fields under the label Target Version . I wasn't sure that is a good idea to move also the existing target version filter (name) to this group. (attached target_version_group.png)
- adds 2 new tests
- breaks an existing tests (QueryTest#test_total_by_project_group_for_spent_hours), but  I'm not sure how to fix the problem. The respective test have also a to do comment to remove some code after this ""issue"":https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/21922 is fixed (and is was fixed). 

I think that this ticket is related to #21249

9306,Per-tracker issue categories,Lars Erik Gullerud,New,Is duplicate of #23747,"It would be very useful when defining categories inside a Project if one could select what trackers this category is valid for (similar to the way one selects what trackers are used in a Project).

Case example:

For our ""feature"" tracker we only need 3 categories, each assigned to one of three users who will follow up the feature request and do a design for that area. However for ""bugs"" tracker there are a lot more categories as these are assigned to individual engineers responsible for a given area. Having to see (and be able to select!) all these categories in the ""feature"" tracker makes our users submit a lot of requests that end up in the wrong place.

Of course we could split every single project into sub-projects and have only one tracker (and one set of categories) in each sub-project, however this is a less than optimal workaround..."

6609,% Done for Parent Tasks [2],Ewan Makepeace,Reopened,"Is duplicate of #18184, Is duplicate of #13116, Is duplicate of #15692, Is duplicate of #23529","If I have parent tasks and sub tasks and I use manual (per issue) % done values, then the parent gets the average of the values of the subtasks.
However if I use the option to set % done from status updates then instead of inheriting its % done from the subtasks it takes it from the status attached on the parent task.

Example:

!parent.jpg!

In this case 3 of 4 subtasks are finished and the 4th is in progress, yet the parent task remains at 10% because its status is just 'Developing' (which means not much for a container task).

I actually have two separate requests here:

# I think that parent tasks should inherit their done% from the sub tasks in both modes (note that when using per-issue Done% values I do not get the option to pick a value for the parent, it is always computed, so why not for the by-status version too?)
# Rather than average the %Done of the child tasks I would prefer to weight them by the estimated time of each subtask, so if I have 2 x 8 hr tasks finished and one 4 hour task not started the parent would be at 80% and not 66%.

10999,Ticket list filter: More flexible filter conditions,Frank Helk,New,Is duplicate of #23216,"I have not found any workaround on that by now ...

As far as I understand it, the filter conditions for the ticket list (text fields) filter on an exact phrase in any case. With that behaviour, I can't filter for tickets containing i.e. 2 words at random positions in the field. Normally I would circumvent that by just adding another filter on the same field, but unfortunately that is blocked - only one condition per field is allowed.

I would suggest to either

- allow multiple filter conditions on the same field, connected by ""AND"", or
- implement some kind of optional pattern search like RegEx, or
- (preferred) implement search pattern interpretation rules for text fields, like a choice of
  ""exact phrase / all words (AND) / any word (OR) / RegEx"" as drop down list."
