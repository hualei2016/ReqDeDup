Why: 

In some teams, there are several workers with the ability to solve a specific task. It would be preferable to assign
a task to several workers, and the first who gets available would then grab the task, setting the ""being solved""
to himself.

449,Keyboard shortcuts,Motohiro Takayama,Reopened,Is duplicate of #27401,"It would be so convinient and productive if redMine supports keyboard shortcuts like Trac or some nifty web apps.

6609,% Done for Parent Tasks [2],Ewan Makepeace,Reopened,"Is duplicate of #18184, Is duplicate of #13116, Is duplicate of #15692, Is duplicate of #23529","If I have parent tasks and sub tasks and I use manual (per issue) % done values, then the parent gets the average of the values of the subtasks.
However if I use the option to set % done from status updates then instead of inheriting its % done from the subtasks it takes it from the status attached on the parent task.

Example:

!parent.jpg!

In this case 3 of 4 subtasks are finished and the 4th is in progress, yet the parent task remains at 10% because its status is just 'Developing' (which means not much for a container task).

I actually have two separate requests here:

# I think that parent tasks should inherit their done% from the sub tasks in both modes (note that when using per-issue Done% values I do not get the option to pick a value for the parent, it is always computed, so why not for the by-status version too?)
# Rather than average the %Done of the child tasks I would prefer to weight them by the estimated time of each subtask, so if I have 2 x 8 hr tasks finished and one 4 hour task not started the parent would be at 80% and not 66%.

As an example, we may have a marketing group, who has a web unit as part of it.  In some projects it would be good to assign the whole marketing group to see a project, and in some it would be just beneficial to do the web unit or sub group.

This would eliminate the need for duplicate entry of names into different groups.

7997,Merge Issues,Brian Lacy,New,Is duplicate of #25300,"Feature Request: Merge related issues

The idea would be to create a ""Merge Issue"" link next to the ""Duplicate"" and ""Delete"" links when viewing or updating Issues. Clicking it presents a box allowing you to enter an Issue number to merge with. Merging two issues combines all the comments and status updates chronologically (and of course presents an option to re-edit the title of the newly combined issue).

This would be super helpful! Sometimes issues are entered as separate tickets, when in fact they are the same or merely different aspects/perspectives on the same task. We don't want to just delete or close one of them, because they often contain useful comments relating to that particular aspect of the same task. Sorting through all the duplicate issues is a huge pain, but merging the issues would solve this problem."

I would like to be able to watch a target version like I can an issue.

An important part of that is that I would to be able to easily see, and have timely notification of additions to or removals from a target version.

This would help prevent issues from being sneaked into a target version, and to help more people be aware of issues that get dropped from a target version.

I guess the all signing all dancing version of this request is an ability to configure what is watched for. But I would be very happy with the ability to watch all activity associated with specified target versions.

It can happen, for example, when a customer send a problem via email and we need to create a Redmine issue ourself, and give this customer access to the ticket.

I asked Jean-Phillipe on #7412#note-2 to extend the visibility of an issue to observers, and some people liked it, but it was not done because observe mechanism was designed for notification purposes (I now I agree it is not good, that's why I'm creating this feature request).

Create a involve mechanism where some roles can add people in an issue, in a very similar way they add an observer, and the added users have access to the issue the were involved."
8629,Allow assigning issues and/or watcher status to authenticated non members,Paul Wilson,New,Is duplicate of #28405,"This feature request is vaguely similar to #7342 but that issue doesn't particularly fulfill this request.

Our redmine installation is configured to require authentication for access and for manual account activation for self registered accounts.

Since we require authentication for access, most projects on this system are configured as public and the Non member role set to permit view access and edit to forum, issue tracking, wiki, etc. This was done to allow all within the organization to have limited access to all public projects and was working as expected.

But while the majority of the activity within a project is accomplished by the active members of the project team who are all assigned to the project and associated with some role, it is not uncommon for an issue to require action by someone who is not a direct member of the team however, unless a user is actually a member of a project, as Non members they cannot be assigned tasks or designated as watchers.

As a work around, we have an 'Associated' role cloned from the Non member role and an 'Authenticated User' group that includes all (authenticated) users. This Authenticated user group is assigned to every public project with the 'Associated' role but as the number of workflow permutations is a function trackers X roles, a new role requires configuring (and maintaining) an additional workflow for each tracker.

This work around gives us the results we need but it also requires an additional step to ensure each user gets put into the 'Authenticated user' group.

While this work around is more or less acceptable, it would be friendlier if the issue Assignee selection list on the New Issue view and the add watcher list on the update issue view could be sorted and grouped by roles. Or better yet, sorted by roles and have the roles expandable/collapsable! Also, the issue Watcher list on the New Issue view would also be more friendly if it also were a select list as on the update issue view or at least expandable/collapsable as described above.

Case example:

For our ""feature"" tracker we only need 3 categories, each assigned to one of three users who will follow up the feature request and do a design for that area. However for ""bugs"" tracker there are a lot more categories as these are assigned to individual engineers responsible for a given area. Having to see (and be able to select!) all these categories in the ""feature"" tracker makes our users submit a lot of requests that end up in the wrong place.

/projects/redmine/repository/revisions/3310/entry/trunk/app/controllers/issues_controller.rb#L140

The only way to offer this 3rd party web form integration without loosing author information of submitter will need to enable to change the author by a third person. This will need a right to be in a role and then the rest api shall also provide to set the author name.

9912,Expose Redmine server settings via REST API,Alex Last,New,Is duplicate of #26165,"I have some automated tests for Redmine Java API. The unit-tests do not  require any external systems, while the integration ones use a pre-configured Redmine instance (actually, several instances - 1.2.2, 1.3.0, ...).

I could modify the integration tests to start a Redmine server, 
ideally - provide a pre-configured test database instance,
then set some settings like ""authentication required"" and run tests with it.
then turn this setting OFF and run the tests again.

This would eliminate the need to have Redmine running and accessible for everyone running integration tests, plus cover more execution paths.

So, is it possible to support at least some settings manipulation using REST API?

I can list the ones most important for me at this moment:
* ""authentication required""
* provide database settings on Redmine startup (ideally would be if Redmine supported in-memory database like Atlassian Jira)

This is quite useful since it is nice and simple to just get the full response in a single page rather than having to traverse pagination, and a limit of a bit more than 100 is still very performant for many sites -- the limit beyond which performance starts to degrade really depends on the particular site's usage, so should be controllable by the local administrator.

If native PDF rendering within the browser is not supported, then a download will be initiated by the browser anyway.

h3. 2. Displaying a PDF file in repository browser

When accessing ""View"" within the file view in the repository browsers, Redmine currently forces a download of the PDF. Instead an iframe could be rendered which displays the PDF within the Redmine UI. Browser support for this use case is similar to No. 1.


-------

The patch series is based on current trunk (r15332) plus the changes of #22482. If desired, I could isolate the changes further, to make them work without #22482.

h3. @0004-Don-t-force-download-of-PDFs-but-show-in-browser-pre.patch@

The change updates @AttachmentsController@ and @RepositoryController@ to send PDF files with @content-disposition: inline@. (See first use case.)

h3. @0005-Show-pdf-preview-for-repository-files-and-attachment.patch@

The change adds @attachments/pdf@ and @common/_pdf@ views to render PDF files in an iframe/object construct. (See second use case.)

Since we cannot easily know the PDF’s dimensions, the frame size follows the following rules:

* it is as wide as possible (100%)
* in general it is as high as it is wide
* it is never higher than 80 % of the viewport (80vh), since we want to make sure, that there is always a bit of Redmine UI visible to avoid getting “trapped” within the frame

Using a nested object/iframe structure was taken from http://pdfobject.com/static.html"
22701,Allow forward reference to parent when importing issues,Gregor Schmidt,Closed,Is duplicate of #25799,"When importing issues via CSV with parent relations, the parent issues need to be positioned before child issues. Otherwise the relation will be ignored.

To work around this limitation, the issue import could be extended to use multiple passes:

# one to import basic issue properties
# one to import relations to other issues

This way it becomes easier to create the CSV files for imports, since order is no longer important.

This change would also be a prerequisite to import general issue relations. Since those cannot be more complex that parent relations and cannot necessarily be linearized properly.



Attached you find a patch series based on trunk r15361.

While implemented the changes, I tried to keep the @Import@ free from issue related information. Other existing @Import@ sub classes - within plugins e.g. - should need as little updates as possible.


h3. 0001 Extend test data for issue import

This change adds two rows to the existing issue import fixture file. These rows contain a parent and a child issue, while the parent is placed after the child. This would not import properly given the current implementation.

The patch also updates the existing tests, where the number of imported issues is asserted.

h3. 0002 Add test for issue relations to following rows

This patch extends the existing parent issue import test to also verify that the newly introduced parent child relation is properly imported. This test fails with the current implementation.

h3. 0003 Multi-pass CSV import

This patch defines a @required_passes@ method within @Import@ which returns @1@ by default and may be overwritten in sub classes. The @IssueImport@ does so and returns @1@ if no @parent_id@ mapping was set, otherwise it returns @2@.

The @run@ method is split into @run@ and @run_pass@. The first one is recursive and called once for each pass. It also handles the @max_*@ options. The second is only responsible for reading the rows, creating or updating the ImportItems and passing everything to @build_object@.

Since @build_object@ may now be called multiple times (once for each pass), the argument list was extended to provide more context. If somebody created a custom import in a plugin, this would need to be changed by the plugin's author.

In the @IssueImport@, @build_object@ is now split into @build_issue@ and @build_relations@, the first is called in the first pass, the second in pass 2.

The patch also contains a migration, which adds a @completed_passes@ field to @ImportItem@. This is needed to properly (re-)store progress for multi-step imports, like the ones via the web UI.

Finally the patch adds some test to make sure, that the general behavior of multi-step imports did not change with the introduction of multi-pass imports.


*Disclaimer*: I know, this is a rather large change to fix a minor nuisance. But as mentioned earlier, I think, this change is a necessary prerequisite to support importing ""Related Issues"" properly, which I would like to contribute next, if this patch is accepted."

It'll very helpful to have the possibility to filter after target version status (open/locked/closed) and target version due date (effective_date). With these 2 new filters you can cover most of the use cases related to target version.

- a query that returns all the issues that are assigned in versions with due date

The attached patch:

* there is no way to use an ""OR"" clause.
* there is no good way to search for multiple issues (its possible to select multiple trackers, statuses, etc. but it is not possible to select multiple subjects nor is it possible to define separate filters per selected filter (e.g. different assignee for each selected tracker) and other similar use cases).

-------

One proposed solution:
I think one of the ""more simple"" methods of adding this feature would be to add a way to define multiple sets of ""queries""/filters in one search:

Ex. you need to search for two types of issues at once. Tracker A that are assigned to Paul and Tracker B that are assigned to John. You need to see both of these side-by-side to be able to compare the due dates between the two and take action as needed.
You define your first ""query""/filter by filtering for Tracker: ""A"" and Assigned to: ""Paul"". After that, you click a ""+"" icon below the filter/options that adds another set of filter/options and you can define your second ""query""/filter by setting Tracker: ""B"" and Assigned to: ""John"". Click apply and it will run both queries, distinct & union the result set and display accordingly. The displayed columns would be shared between all issues.

This could also lead into some sort of combined custom query searching capability if that is something you guys want to explore.

If I'm requesting issues to be sorted by due date, it means due date is of importance to me, so issues with an assigned due date should be somehow highlighted over those without (i.e.: by sorting before).

Not having an assigned due date on an issue means I don't know/it doesn't matter and, again, known info should prevail over _""don't knows/doesn't matters""_.

Excluding in the query issues without due date may make sense sometimes but I can think of a lot of scenarios when it doesn't (i.e.: multifilter: I still want to see issues at critical priority sorted before any issues at normal priority, even if no due date is assigned to them).
An issue can have an implicit due date as long it has a target version assigned (that of the target version).

I can't think of an user case where things with no due date should be meaningfully presented before those with a due date when sorting ascending order.

So, in sorting by due date (ascending), I would expect issues sorted like this:
* 1/MAR/2016
* 2/MAR/2016
* no due date [or have it set to its target version's one and sort accordingly]

First, some background.

I am not a ruby, or even a web developer. I write embedded code, and I would like to use Redmine to help manage my projects. I have some linux skills, but am a long way from being a guru.

I installed Redmine on an Ubuntu 16.04, Apache, and MySQL system using ""sudo apt-get"". For me, this was the easiest, most consistent way to resolve all dependencies and get a basic working system up and running. Trying to resolve all the discrepancies between the various installation instructions in the Guide drove me to madness. I finally found some installation instructions on the Ubuntu help pages that delivered a working system.

Now that it is installed, I cannot seem to get plugins working. I believe this is due to permissions. Since the system was installed with ""sudo apt-get install ..."" the files have root permissions. If I try to run the various commands indicated in the various plugin guides I usually get errors regarding permissions. (I am repeating my journey to madness trying to resolve all the unexplained differences) . If I try to run the commands with sudo, I get errors or warnings about running as root. In most cases I end up with a broken system. I have not figured out the magical incantation to install this plugin yet.

The feature request I have is to have an Administration page where you could upload the zip file, and it would install the plug-in to the appropriate directory, backup the appropriate files (as needed), run the appropriate commands with the appropriate credentials, and deliver a working system at the end.

I think this would help make this system a lot more usable to non-ruby developers."

Actually we want to give access (in restricted view, no edit) to our customers their projects but we don't want customers to see the discussion with our partner, so disable the Issue history for them.


Is it possible by any way to do it ?
I think it would be great to implement this in the ""Roles and permissions"" as there is already an option for hiding Wiki History to a role like in the screenshot attached.

Thanks !"

currently redmine lists all projects on the projects page if a user is admin of a redmine instance.

I think it might be more sensible to hide the projects the user is not a regular team member of.
We use Redmine in our organisation and have currenty 90 projects.
There are several admins assigned via the LDAP attribute and it works quite fine.

Though, if the number of projects increases, the project overview page renders quite useless because you will effectively be unable to find your projects.
Ok, the own projects are highlighted by a little yellow star. But I think it might be quite helpful to hide the projects I have administrative access to per default and show these on demand.

Maybe I can assist you on implementing this behaviour but I need a advise where to start from.
Organisations and companies with a large user base and an elaborated project structure might be very grateful.

Thank a lot in advance!

25454,Add bulk edit after save hook,Serghei Zagorinyak,Closed,Is duplicate of #8757,"Correct me if I'm mistaken, but now there only exists a @issue_bulk_edit_before_save@ controller hook. This makes it impossible to provide consistent behavior for plugins implementing edit_after_save controller hooks.

Say, a user edits an issue via issue view and triggers a @issue_edit_after_save_hook@ which handles the issue in a proper way. The same is expected to happen when an issue is edited via context menu (right click) in any multiple issues view, but there is no way to provide that as @bulk_edit@ method is called for context menus and there is no @issue_bulk_edit_after_save@ hook which makes @issue_edit_after_save@ hook useless.

I think it would be useful to have something like this in issues#bulk_edit controller method:

<pre>
def bulk_edit
  ...
  @issues.each do |orig_issue|
    ...

    begin        
      Issue.transaction do

        issue.save!

26791,Send individual notification mails per mail recipient,Holger Just,Closed,"Is duplicate of #4231, Is duplicate of #11981, Is duplicate of #32291","With this patch series, we are introducing the general concept to send multiple mails per notification event. Specifically, we are sending one mail per recipient user. Each of those mails is rendered in the context of the recipient (i.e. with @User.current@ set to the recipient). The mails can be sent immediately or optionally delayed using ActiveJob.

This approach has a couple of advantages over the existing approach of sending a single mail to multiple recipients:

* We ensure object visibility for the rendered mails in the most generic way. Since each mail is rendered with @User.current@ set to the recipient, all content rendered in the mail (including shown issue attributes, macros and links in rendered textile text, ...) is guaranteed to only be visible to the user without having to ensure this manually for each mail using the same visibility rules as used for the HTML views already.
* The mail will always be sent in the recipients language, even if multiple users with different languages are notified
* There is no risk of the whole notification mail being rejected because of a single invalid recipient address (see #8157, #6829, #8733 and a lot of duplicates)

In the long run, it will also allow us to introduce user-specific additional information in the rendered notification, e.g. related issues, links to assign the issue, ...

With this new approach, we do have a some challenges which we are trying to address separately:

* Since each mail is always rendered with an adapted @User.current@, any mail views which expected to use the original @User.current@ need to be adapted. In Redmine core, this only affects the security notifications.
* Depending on the number of recipients for a notification, there might be many rendered mails which can take some time in the request. To ensure a snappy response, we can use ActiveJob to render and send the mails in the background. This can make the @async_*@ delivery methods obsolete.

h2. Reminder: How mail sending works in plain Rails (and Redmine)

This patch series changes how mails are generated and delivered. Let's first look at how a mail normally gets generated and delivered in ActionMailer.

* @mail = Mailer.news_added(news)@ - The user calls a class-method of the Mailer class (a child-class of ActionMailer::Base). This method is usually not implemented in the @Mailer@ class itself. Instead, there is a ""@method_missing@"":https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v5.1.2/actionmailer/lib/action_mailer/base.rb#L576-L582 method on @ActionMailer::Base@. Here, ActionMailer creates a @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object. Which is basically a delegator to an _eventually rendered_ mail object. Now, the mail is not actually rendered here. The @MessageDelivery@ object only collects all arguments it needs to eventually render the mail. This happens implicitly when any method on the mail is accessed (e.g. when the mail is about to be delivered). The @MessageDelivery@ delegator is returned to the user.

Now that we have the (delegated) mail, we can deliver it with @mail.deliver@. This method used to be the only delivery method. With newer Rails versions, there is (with some variations) @deliver_now@ and @deliver_later@. Redmine usually calls @deliver@ which in source:trunk/config/initializers/10-patches.rb#L160 calls @deliver_now@ currently.

When calling @mail.deliver@, the delegator starts to render the mail:

* ""@MessageDelivery#processed_mailer@"":https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v5.1.3/actionmailer/lib/action_mailer/message_delivery.rb#L103-L107 creates a new @Mailer@ instance and calls @process@ on it.
* @Mailer#process(:news_added, news)@ - The @process@ method is part of ActionMailer (and in turn part of the @ActionController@ framework on which ActionMailer is based on). Among things, it calls the specified action, i.e. the instance method.
* @Mailer#news_added(news)@ - This instance method is implemented on the Mailer class and is responsible to render the actual mail message. Here, we set headers, instance variables for the view and basically do the usual controller stuff. With a final call to @mail@, we eventually render a single mail and return a @Mail::Message@ object.
* This returned @Mail::Message@ object is delivered with a call to @Mail::Message#deliver_now@.

h2. How we hook into this process

Now, in order to send multiple mails, we hook into this process to render (and deliver) multiple mails. We want to ensure two things:

* We want to create multiple mails, one per recipient and deliver them all in one go.
* When rendering the mail (i.e. when calling the Mailer's instance method), we want to set @User.current@ to the recipient user and set it back to the original value after the rendering is done

These two goals are achieved with two specific changes to our Mailer:

We introduce a wrapper class called @Mailer::MultiMessage@. Instances of this class wrap multiple @Mail::Message@ objects (or rather @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ objects which delegate to @Mail::Message@ objects). The class provides the same @deliver_*@ methods as the original @Mail::Message@ objects. When calling such a method, we are calling it on each of the wrapped messages. This allows us to use an instance of this class in place of a @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object.

We use this class by implementing _class methods_ for each mailer action. These class methods implement the same external interface (i.e. accept the same arguments) as the old instance methods. This ensures that we keep the existing public interface. The class methods fetch the recipient users for the respective object (i.e. the issue, news, comment, ...). We use @Mailer::MultiMessage#for@ to add an @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object for each recipient which eventually renders the mail.

When creating the delegator, we also pass the recipient user to the arguments for the mail rendering. We use this user in the overwritten @Mailer#process@ method to set @User.current@ and their language before actually rendering the message. This convention allows us to keep the interfaces clear: the user is only passed between the class method and @Mailer#process@ but doesn't need to be specified on the instance action. Here, it is already set as @User.current@ for each rendered mail.

We also extend @Mailer.method_missing@ (on the class) to create a single-mail @Mailer::MultiMessage@ object with the current user in case the class method for an action is not explicitly overwritten. This ensures that our convention of always passing a user to @Mailer#process@ is kept up even if a plugin only adds an instance method (which was valid before).

h2. What we tried and did not work

I first attempted to set the current user directly in the action's class method. and reset it directly afterwards. That would have made the code much more localized. However, due to the delayed rendering of the mail with the @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object, the mail will be rendered only after we have already reset the current user.

One way to work around this would be to introduce @deliver_*@ methods (like the now obsolete @Mailer.deliver_issue_add@ method). However doing so would have changed the intended external interface of our @Mailer@ class and would likely lead to integration pain with all existing Redmine plugins sending mail.

h2. What we ship

We ship three patches here:

* @0001-Send-individual-emails-for-each-mail-recipient.patch@ - The main implementation including tests.
* @0002-Cleanup-Remove-Issue-each_notification-and-Journal-e.patch@ - Removes unneccessary methods for grouping recipients based on custom field visibility
* @0003-Optional-Ensure-that-ActiveRecord-Base-objects-are-f.patch@ - An optional patch which changes the serialization behavior when sending mails with ActiveJob (e.g. with @Mailer.news_added(news).deliver_later@). By default, Rails serialized the arguments as a globalid (which is basically a reference to the object in the database identified by its ID). If there are concurrent changes to e.g. a newly created issue, this might result in notifications using the new state instead of the original state. With this patch, we serialize the exact attributes of the given objects into the job. Since this also causes nested attributes to be serialized along, care must be taken to avoid reference errors. In general, we should probably try to use mostly immutable state in the database where it is an important consideration that the notification state is exactly shown in the DB.

h2. Future work

h3. ActiveJob sending

If the general direction of this patch is accepted, it is probably desireable to move the mail sending to ActiveJob completely. This could replace the @async_*@ delivery methods [[EmailConfiguration#Asynchronous-delivery_methods|currently configurable]] in @configuration.yml@. This change can either be hardcoded in source:trunk/config/initializers/10-patches.rb#L160 or made configurable with a setting. I'll be glad to provide a patch for this. It would only be a few lines of code.

By default, we could use the in-process ActiveJob runner to send mails. More advanced users with a dedicated job worker (e.g. delayed job) can easily switch to that without changes to the Redmine code itself.

h3. BCC recipients

Since each user gets their own mail, we can probably remove the setting to send mails with BCC completely. If plugins want to send mails to non-user recipients, we would have to make sure to either set the recipients manually on BCC or group them appropriately. It is not a required setting in Redmine core anymore though."

28198,Support issue relations when importing issues,Gregor Schmidt,Closed,Is duplicate of #33330,"As promised in #22701, I now would like to propose a patch, which adds handling of issue relations to the CSV importer.

h3. Usage

The attached patch extends the import configuration view with a new block, so that users may select a column for each relation type. The parent issue field also moved to the new block, since it's conceptually related.

Within the CSV file the columns may define multiple relations of the same type, each separated with @,@. Related issues follow the same rules as parent issues. A string preceded with a @#@ is supposed to be an existing issue. Without the @#@ it's supposed to be another row within the import file. For _follows_ and _precedes_ relations an additional delay may be present, e.g. @#12 3d@ specifying a relation to issue @#12@ and a delay of 3 days.

h3. Technical notes

Since issue relations may only be created when the issue was already saved, I've added a second step to the import. Additionally to @build_object@, which needs to be implemented by @Import@ sub classes, there's also a @extend_object@ method now. This is used by the @IssueImporter@ to save the relations after the issue was already saved successfully.


h3. Additional considerations

Initially, I wanted to build the import, so that issue relations exported from Redmine could be imported directly. But the format that's used by the exporter was designed for humans, not so much for computers. Most importantly, to parse this format we would need to grep for the localized relation names, which might even change between versions of Redmine. Therefore I settled for the proposed approach of having separate columns for each relation type."

In general it is possible to set the issues visibility as ""ALL issues"" but this is not a good solution when you want to limit access to some issues for certain people (more than author and assigned to).

Therefore, I kindly ask developers for modifying existing or adding a new option of issues visibility that would provide access for the author, the assigned and additionally for the watchers."
28234,Add CSV Import for Time Entries,Gregor Schmidt,Closed,Is duplicate of #25578,"h3. Preface

The imports controller was obviously built to be used for more than just issue imports. But since Redmine currently only supports issue imports, there are now some places, where assumptions about the issue import are hard-coded.

There are some plugins out there, which add other kinds of CSV imports to Redmine, but none of them seems to use the imports controller. I assume, it's because of the shortcomings mentioned above. I wanted to improve this situation, so I decided to build a time entry importer and - along the way - generalize the imports controller so that it's able to handle more than just issues.

h3. Preparations

The first patch attached extracts the issue related view parts into partials which are determined by convention. They are all prefixed with the imported model name, i.e. @_issues@. 

The issue related model parts are moved to the import model. Those are, e.g. the proper menu item, the authorization or the layout. Strictly speaking they should be located on the controller level, but I did not want to build sub classes of the imports controller for each and every kind of import.

h3. Adding the time entry import

The second patch attached adds the time entry import. It's using the newly introduced extension points to fill in the blanks. To provide a way for the user to find the new import, I've added the @timelog/_sidebar@ partial, similar to the one for issues. This new sidebar partial is now used in the timelog views and it contains a link to the import.

*Note:* within said partial, I've mis/re-used an i18n key @label_time_entries_visibility_all@ since it was providing the desired text in German and English. I did not want to introduce a new key based on the existing one, since that would have probably caused major merge problems. If desired, I may of course do that anyway.

h3. Closing notes

The second patch may of course also become a plugin. The main point of this patch (series) was it, to allow plugins to reuse the existing plugin infrastructure. Without the first patch though, a plugin author would need copy most of the views and functionality of the imports class, which is undesirable (at least for the plugin author).

* some people may not like to be *forced to resign from their privacy*. When user is forced to provide data he does not want to, he will probably provide fake data. Value of fake data is not greater that that of no data. This is related to #28106.
* there is already option in Redmine to set *user display format to login only* (instead of first/last name).
* some jurisdictions may require sites that *gather personal data to comply with specific laws*. Again if Redmine is used by open source project communities it may place an unnecessary burden on site administrators.

33479,Make other destinations visible in the Redmine notification email,Yuuki NARA,Closed,Is duplicate of #30787,"Make other destinations visible in the Redmine notification email

h1. Proposal

In Redmine4.0, other destinations are no longer displayed in the notification email.

This is a side effect of the following changes in Redmine 4.0.
https://redmine.org/issues/26791

Depending on the contents of the ticket, it may be necessary to confirm who is notified.
For example, the response may change depending on whether the trouble ticket content is delivered to the CEO.

In Redmine3.4, it was found from the To / Cc column of the notification email that the email was sent to someone else.
In Redmine 4.0 or later, you can not understand without checking the ticket.

Also, the amount sent to the person who has been set to ""notify all"" in the personal settings cannot be confirmed on the ticket.

h1. Solution

There is no problem in sending individual emails.
The only inconvenience is that you can no longer check the simultaneous notification destination directly from the email.

It seems that the conventional To / Cc (watch) can be added to the beginning of the email text by setting the individual ID unit.

h1. Supplement

In Redmine3.X, there was a side effect that other destinations could be known by batch mailing. (Specification changed in 4.0)
It seems that it was not recognized that there were cases where this was used as a substantial function.
(In some cases, it may be necessary to respond depending on the email notification destination)

You can tell by checking the ticket from the link on the notification email, but it will be a burden if there are many cases.

The value of the limit is hardcoded to 100.
It's very long to get for example 20000 objects - 200 requests in ~3 minutes. But it's faster with hardcoded limit 10000 - ~20 seconds only.

Please, add possibility to configure limit used to retrieve objects for an API response.

33612,Expose repository version via REST API,Tom Quern,Closed,Is duplicate of #5901,"For Redmine clients interacting with different versions of the Redmine server it would be beneficial to have an easy way to identify the server version. Currently this information is available in the web UI: <your-host>/admin/info and can be scrapped from the page (e.g. with Jsoup), but it's a hack. Having a REST endpoint with that information exposed would be great.

Or is there a more convenient workaround than the one mentioned above?"
33672,Project Responsible Field,Jean B,Closed,Is duplicate of #11294,"Hello,

I'll try to explain the feature with my real life example. 
One day person came and asked me to create a project for him, so I duplicated a template for him and all fine. The problem is: now when I click in ""My Page"", it shows to me the issues related to that project which I don't care and I also used to receive e-mails from it (not sure if the e-mail is still being sent after Redmine 4).
So, what I imagine, is a simple way on the settings of selecting another person to be the responsible one, maybe a checkbox similar to adding member to a project. I imagine that this information is stored somewhere.

Thanks!

34700,Allow to use watch_by filter in the global issues list,Holger Just,Closed,Related to #8160,"In #8160, we introduced the ability to filter by specific watchers (rather than just ""me""). However, due to the permission check inside the @Query#watcher_values@ method, this capability was only available inside a project. In the global issues view, the filter still only offered ""me"".

The attached patch against current trunk (r20742) fixes this behavior to also offer all visible watchers on the global issues view. The patch is a git patch which can be applied with

I think it would be convenient to be able to copy a simple URL from the view.

* URL of the issue to be copied： @https://<your redmine>/issues/1@
* URL of the issue journal to be copied： @http://<your redmine>/issues/1#note-1@"
34714,Move delete button for issues and journals to the dropdown menu,Mizuki ISHIKAWA,Closed,Related to #34703,"I would like to include infrequently used link such as Delete and Copy in Actions Dropdown.

The reason for making this issue:
* There are many icons on the view, so I would like to make it a little simpler.
* I am trying to increase the number of ""copy links"" links in #34703. Then there will be more icons than now.
* Journal action links only show icons, but there are some features that are difficult to understand with just the icons.

34715,Filter issues by file description,Go MAEDA,Closed,,"Currently, Redmine has a feature to filter issues by attachment file name (#2783).

I think it would be even useful if it is possible to filter issues by attachment file description. Using both file name and description makes it much easier to find files or issues. "
34718,Auto guess file encoding when importing CSV file,Go MAEDA,Closed,,"When importing a CSV file, file encoding is pre-selected according to general_csv_encoding in config/locales/*.yml. For example, ""CP932"" is selected by default when your language setting is Japanese.

I often use CSV files with UTF-8 encoding, but it's a bother to re-select UTF-8 in the encoding drop-down every time.

It would be nice if Redmine auto guesses the file encoding when importing a CSV file. Redmine already auto guess file encoding when displaying attached files or repository contents using @Setting.repositories_encodings@.

34794,Allow newlines and quote characters within mail body delimiters,Holger Just,Closed,,"When processing incoming emails, there is the possibility to define body delimiters after which no further content should be read from the mail body.

When defining long delimiters (e.g. commonly in @Setting.emails_header@), the delimiter may break into multiple lines in replies with (nested) quote characters at the beginning of lines.

With the attached patch, we extend the handling of ""normal"" delimiters (i.e. delimiters not defined as regular expressions) so that any space within the delimiter can also span multiple lines with optional quote characters at the front. This ensures that even delimiters broken over multiple lines in incoming mails will be recognized as such.

34833,Allow redmine to provide reply-to email header,Gary Aitken,Closed,,"Redmine outgoing email does not provide a reply-to header.  Many email relays which require a user-id/pw login (e.g. smtp.gmail.com) replace the sender@domain with the user-id of the login account.  Consequently, when the receiver replies to the email, it goes to the login user-id and domain, rather than the sender user@domain set by redmine where the issue originated.

This patch provides a check-box in the email-notifications settings which, when set, causes redmine to provide a reply-to header identical to the sender (user@domain).  This allows replies to be routed to the redmine instance where they originated, and be incorporated into the issue.

35001,Disable API authentication with username and password when two-factor authentication is enabled for the user,Go MAEDA,Closed,Related to #1237,"In Redmine 4.2, two-factor authentication has been introduced.

When two-factor authentication is enabled, it becomes difficult for an attacker to log in to Redmine even if he knows the username and password.

However, API authentication is not covered by two-factor authentication. Currently, there are three methods of API authentication:

1. send the user's API key via X-Redmine-API-Key header
2. basic authentication with the user's API key ( username is the API key and password is a random string)
3. basic authentication with user name and password

If you have two-factor authentication enabled, I think the third method will be problematic. This is because even though the web UI can prevent an attacker from logging in with an illegally obtained username and password, they can still use that username and password to access the data via the API.

To address this risk, I suggest disabling basic authentication with username and password for users who have two-factor authentication enabled.

I conclude that it has been decided to end the 4.x development after the recent 4.2 release.

Yet, I see that this is not clear for (close) community members who are referring to a (potential) 4.3 release (see eg. #30820#note-15, #32424#note-36, #32424#note-37).

35086,Please consider changing the way how 2FA is set up,robert heiler,Closed,"Related to #35087, Related to #34070, Related to #31920, Related to #1237","Hey guys,

I don't want to write too much, so it is not hard for you to handle this
issue.

Recently the ruby bug tracker has been changed to require 2FA.

This is a problem for me as I don't have a smartphone, so the change
locked me out of the bug tracker.

Anyway - this is not about that; I would like to suggest a few things.

(1) Right now if you click ""sign out"" you can not sign out because
the 2FA wall shows up:

""The administrator requires you to enable two-factor authentication.""

This should be different. It should ALWAYS be possible to sign out
again. Sure I can use cookies or use another browser, but I logged
into my account of ~13 years just now. Now the 2FA wall prevents me
from doing anything, including ""sign out"". This is not good UI.

We should be able to log out (sign out) again.

Anyway this is a smaller part.

(2) The bigger issue is that I don't get any information about
WHY 2FA is suddenly used, and who enabled it. Yes, I get it,
the site owner did so, but perhaps the site owner was not aware
that this will effectively perma-ban some users. Not everyone
has a smartphone or can use 2FA. I already explained this
on rubygems.org the github issue tracker, that mandatory 2FA
means I can no longer use rubygems, so I'd have to remove
my account at rubygems.org (whereas at github I could still
publish that code, so this is weird...)

Please consider (2), because it means that the admin of a
site may accidentally retire people from ruby, without
even intending to do so. To me this is a dealbreaker, 
because it means I can no longer use the official bug tracker
of ruby, which then means I can no longer voice my concern
(I don't use emails really ... never liked emails in ~over
20 years...). That means I'd become a second class citizen
to ruby, compared to other users, and since I have no intention
to accept this, it would effectively mean that I would also
abandon ruby in the long run.

Ruby is a great language, but to me mandatory 2FA is not
acceptable. While this is not the fault of redmine itself,
I think usability wise several things could be improved.

I assume none of you guys so far thought about how this
could cause friction and strife, so hopefully the way how
2FA is explained to users can change in the long run. I
had slowly collect that information since nothing
was announced anywhere! Suddenly from one day to the
other I was slapped into the face with that 2FA wall,
so perhaps you can understand my frustration here."

is there a plugin working for latest redmine releases enabling us to create filters in

If a new ticket falls into this filter, we'd like to receive email notifications.

35229,SSE refresh,David Doležal,Closed,,"Hi,
I tried quite long time to developed solution how automatically refresh issue's notes without refreshing whole page.

I tested soulution via AJAX or JS with refreshing only DIV ""history"" using timer. For example:
<pre>
$(document).ready(function(){
setInterval(function(){
      $( ""#history"" ).load(window.location.href + "" #history."");
      /*$( ""#tab-content-history"").load(window.location.href + "" #tab-content-history.tab-content"");*/
}, 30000);
});
</pre> 
It doesn't work how I expacted. Page is refreshed, but notes don't show. 
I tested for example plugin redmine_refresh.

But I think it exists better way how it solved. I'm aiming on Server-Sent Event. gem ld-evensource

How I imagine it can works - focused on issue-detail page:
On server running ""services"" who listen changes on issues (create issue, update issue, ...). 

If issue is new, then work as normal (like now).
If issue is updated, then check attributes which was changed and journal has no notes, then reload div #history, show tab History and Changes
If issue is updated, then check attributes which was changed and journal has note, then reload div #history, show tabs History, Notes and Changes and show note.

Maybe I forgot some stuff.

I would like to create discussion about this problem, so come to talk about it. I appreciate it. :-) Redmine is great, but this feature will send him on Olymp... :-)

Feel free for question. 

With best regards

A good improvement would be:
in the project settings, having he possibility to define the ""assignee"" as follow:
- all -> the entire project members (default)
- group -> list of users within a designated group (could be more than one group selected)
- role -> list of users within a given role (could be more than one role selected) ie: my_exerts

This is not perfect as some users would require having the list of assignee to be customize base on the issue position within a given workflow. But, nevertheless, it would be a nice improvement.

35645,Request for reconsideration of removal of 'View all issues' link,Mischa The Evil,New,Related to #30294,"Yesterday I started doing some development work on Redmine again. The first thing that I stumbled upon was that the 'View all issues' link in the issues sidebar was removed in r18304. Although I see the merit of its removal with #30294, it really annoys me not having that link available (to such an extend that I quickly created a ""small plugin"":/plugins/redmine_add_all_issues_link_in_issues_sidebar to restore it on the issues show view).
The reason for this annoyance is that it was the only way to clear the current, not-saved query straight from the issues show view without first going back to the issues index view and then subsequently clicking on the clear button. With the link on issues show it is possible to go back to the default issues list without the need of an additional click on the clear button to clear the in-memory query. All the other (currently available) links that go back to the issues index view (project menu and query links on the index show view) retain the current query.

So, to make a long story short, I'd like to request a reconsideration of the decision for the removal of this link. This is also rooted in the fact that I think more (power) users will be/have been bitten by this change.

FTR:
* I have no problems with the move of the other links ('Summary' and 'Import') to the drop-down menu. This request is just about the 'View all issues' link.
* I haven't looked into the changes of the 'Spent time' sidebar yet, but the points of the 'Issues sidebar' might also apply to those views.
* If the removal decision is indeed reverted then it would be viable to subsequently also revert the addition of the clear query buttons added in #31640, as they would become obsolete if the 'View all issues' link is added back in.
* I am also ok if my request will be declined. I'll then just keep using my plugin to restore the old situation...

1. Currently, when rendering an issue PDF, macros are only expanded in the description, but not when rendering custom fields with fulltext formatting enabled. The patch changes the behaviour so that formatted full-width custom fields are rendered in the same way the description is rendered, fully interpreting macros. The behaviour for rendering normal-width custom fields is unchanged, probably it is better to leave it as is due to space constraints.
2. Thumbnail macro output was not rendered properly (in the issue description and elsewhere) because the thumbnail image file could not be retrieved - the second patch extends @get_image_filename@ to check for thumbnail URLs and retrieve the proper file path in that case.

As stated on the Install page the latest officially supported release is MySQL 5.6, which has been EOL since February of 2021. MySQL 5.7 seems to work just fine but is not yet officially supported (it's on the roadmap for the next major release after 5.0!) and has an EOL date of October 2023 (aka slightly over 2 years from today). At the current speed of development I fear that MySQL will be EOL long before it is officially supported by Redmine. MariaDB is not supported at all.

35749,Call Redmine::Hook.call_hook(:model_changeset_scan_commit_for_issue_ids_pre_issue_update) not only in case of a fixed issue with 'fixes' keyword,Sandro Frenzel,New,,"In

app/models/changeset.rb

there is a hook _:model_changeset_scan_commit_for_issue_ids_pre_issue_update_ which is called only if an issue was marked as fixed ('fixes' keyword) within a commit message.

So, there is no possibility to run an own adapter or do other things when an issue just changed within a commit message with 'refs' keyword.

Moving the lines

<pre>
    Redmine::Hook.call_hook(:model_changeset_scan_commit_for_issue_ids_pre_issue_update,

However, OpenId was obsoleted by OpenID Connect some years ago and most OpenID providers discontinued their services. Now it is very difficult to find a web service with an OpenID provider service. This means that it is difficult for Redmine users to start using OpenID login. And it is not easy for us to test if Redmine's OpenID support is working properly.

Given this situation, probably very few users are using OpenID login in Redmine. I think it is time to remove OpenID support from Redmine."

I'm in need to add a fail2ban filter/jail which allows blocking of IPs trying to use the REST api unauthorized.

It would be nice to additionally display the requesting IP in that log line, e.g.:

<pre>

It wouldn't need the project and user level defaults though. It would IMHO be a more complete (than r19505) solution to the need expressed in #32818.

With this feature, the @project_list_display_type@ setting added in r19505 can be removed."
35796,Allow subject and priority issue attributes (i.e. tracker fields) to be disablable,Mischa The Evil,New,Related to #38416,"I see many use-cases where items which are tracked as Redmine issues lack a priority and/or a subject. They could e.g. lack both a priority and a subject altogether or lack a priority and substitute the subject attribute with a title or name attribute in the form of a custom field.

I think it would be great if Redmine could support such configurations without the need for users/admins to resort to (custom) workarounds. That way, the bare minimum of issue attributes would consist of only the status attribute (by disabling all the fields in the tracker config combined with setting the remaining fields to read-only in the workflow field permissions).

Use-case examples:
* collection management (books/movies/CDs/DVDs/BDs/recipes, etc.)
* (software) license management
* inventory management
* contact management
* vacation-/presence management
* appointment management
* etc.

In the case that such entities are tracked as Redmine issues, an administrator can already modify/override the respective Redmine core translations easily via a plugin to globally rename 'issues' into a more general term like 'items'. This cannot be done with the same ease to e.g. rename the subject attribute to a title attribute as issues of other trackers (e.g. an old-school defect tracker) use the same attribute OOTB, hence the request to also make the subject attribute disablable."

35815,Specifying the size of the preview image in the text,Igor M,Closed,,"h2. User history

In Jira, it is possible to insert an image in the body of a comment (or wiki) in a reduced size. If you need to increase it, then you need to click and it will become large in lightbox.

* This is very convenient when the description is very large (for example, a wiki). It is inconvenient to return to the attachments.
* The size of the images can be very large. For example, I can take a screenshot from 2 monitors (they record the place, time, changes).

I tried this plugin. It does as it should in attachments, and it is also necessary in the comments.

35839,"API: Unable to distinguish between user and group, for the assigned_to field",Aed Art,New,,"The `assigned_to` field for the `issues` resource, and the `default_assignee` for the `projects` resource return either a reference to an existing user or a group.
Yet, it's not possible to distinguish whether it is one or the other - at least not an easy one via the API.

Developers might have to perform additional requests to be API, in hopes of being able to determine if it's user reference or a group. This might not be as easy as it sounds. You only have the name to match against, which depending on display setting, a user's name will be outputted differently in the reference, making it a bit frustrating attempting to compare against.
Furthermore, there is always a change that a group shares the same id as a user (_do not have enough understanding of the database schema_)?

h3. Possible Solution

Add a new property to the `assigned_to` and `default_assignee` references, indicating exactly it's type.

35889,Textile and Markdown attachment rendering should support third-party formatters,Mischa The Evil,New,"Related to #29752, Related to #15520, Related to #32424, Related to #2025","As it is implemented currently with #29752, Textile and Markdown attachment rendering is supported +only+ for the core formatters for Textile and Markdown.

* Textile attachment rendering currently relies on the _bundled_ (custom) RedCloth3 library.
* Markdown attachment rendering currently relies on the _optional_ Redcarpet (or CommonMark, post #32424) libraries, with a fall-back to @Redmine::WikiFormatting::NullFormatter@.

Given the info above, currently:
* Textile attachment rendering always works, always relying on RedCloth3 (since RedCloth3 is bundled);
* Markdown attachment rendering +*only*+ works with one of the optional Markdown core formatters installed (relying on Redcarpet or CommonMark) and based on @Setting.text_formatting@.

Redmine should also provide support for (custom) third-party Textile and Markdown formatters (e.g. RedCloth4 [via a formatter like provided by e.g. ""redmine_redcloth"":/plugins/redmine_redcloth], kramdown, Maruku, RDiscount, etc.), based on what formatters (core and third-party) are actually available.

Currently, the 
* view for repo (changeset/revision) diffs provides diff content in _descending_ alphabetical order; while the

> You have received this notification because you have either subscribed to it, or are involved in it.
> To change your notification preferences, please click here: http://hostname/my/account
This setting can be changed from Settings -> Notifications -> Email footer.

This approach have several issues:
* the text can be removed by an admin
* the text is not translatable
* the text is too generic and the user cannot understand why he received that notification

My proposal is to replace this text with the real reason of why the user received the notification. In this phase, I propose the following reasons with the according translations:

| *Reason* | *Message* | *Details* |
| @INVOLVED@ | You have received this notification because you are involved in. | user is either author, assignee or previous assignee |
| @MENTIONED@ | You have received this notification because you have been mentioned in. | user in mentioned in that event |
| @SUBSCRIBED@ | You have received this notification because you have subscribed to it. | user is subscribed to that event |
| @WATCHER@ | You have received this notification because you are watching it. | user is a watcher |
| @ADMIN@ | You have received this security notification because you are an administrator. | user is an admin and he received a security notification |

In the future, we can add even a more granular reason for the involved reason: author, assignee or previous assignee.

36252,Make the wiki multi-lingual,C S,New,,"I've been trying for some time to bring the German version of the wiki up to date in the areas of the user guide. This is currently quite tedious, since then all pages that have already been translated with the respective links have to be converted to the German version.

It would be great if the wiki was multilingual.
I imagine it as follows:
* English is the main language
* All pages / hierarchy / etc. are created in English
* A translation will be created / attached with the respective language abbreviation
* No other language page can be created as an independent version, but must always be linked to the ""original""
The logged-in user selects his system language, and accordingly, if the translation is available, it will be redirected to it. If none is available, it ends up on the original, English version."

36370,Add Copy and Archive to the project context menu,Go MAEDA,New,,"Currently, the context menu for a project has four items, ""New subject"", ""Close"", ""Delete"", and ""Settings"". I suggest adding two more buttons, ""Copy"" and ""Archive"". This will allow you to perform most operations on a project without having to go to the Administration page.

* The copy project feature is frequently used The copy feature is a frequently used feature in teams that create new projects by copying template projects. Adding ""Copy"" to the context menu can reduce steps to complete the work
* Archiving a project is preferable to deleting a project because deleted projects cannot be undone. Therefore, the preferable ""Archive"" should be in the context menu if ""Delete"" is in there
* I think adding these two items will not have any negative impact on UI/UX because they are usually hidden in the context menu. In addition, non-admin users cannot see the items even if they open the context menu

2. click in description editions specific button.

but more importantly this is unintuitive, confusing, as well as being ambigious,
because when someone intends to edit something in a issue they assume description editions would be included. Many times people just assume that one needs to be a administrator of the instance to do so, given the ""edit description"" feauture is a little bit not obvious.

SOLUTION
Separate the experience in two in the right upper corner, or by adding a feature/button for just the note section bellow the issue report:
editing -> refering to editions on description
commenting -> refering to further editions on ""notes"" section bellow issue report

I understand that both are the same technically but it makes less understandable, if there isnt a separation of the two. Cheers Irelativism."

36573,Extend config.ru to support sub-uri ootb and cleanup all wiki pages,Tiemo Vorschuetz,New,,"Hi folk,

Almost all of the solutions on the wiki pages are outdated and either never worked or don't work anymore with version 4.x as discussed several times. From my point of view, the only sensible way is to extend config.ru. This approach works as expected. Unfortunately, I have wasted days over past few years at this point trying to get Redmine working under a sub-URI. This even led to me losing almost all of my beautiful hair. And just as ugly as it makes me look now, is trying through all the possibilities enumerated over several wiki pages.

My suggestion: The config.ru should therefore look like this out-of-the-box:

<pre>
# This file is used by Rack-based servers to start the application.

require ::File.expand_path('../config/environment', __FILE__)
map ENV['REDMINE_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT'] || '/' do
    run RedmineApp::Application
end
</pre>

This can then be used to configure the Docker image by one variable, for example if you want to update a legacy system and can't reassign the uri because of backwards compatibility.

The config.ru would be usable unchanged with the default configuration and optionally for people who want or need to run redmine under a sub-URI.

Is there anything against changing the delivered config.ru in the codebase as mentioned above?

36691,Background job and dedicated status for project deletion,Jens Krämer,Closed,"Related to #31076, Related to #33422, Related to #37210","Due to the deletion of dependent objects (issues etc) and child projects,
project deletion may take a long time.

This patch, which was extracted from [Planio](https://plan.io/redmine-hosting),
moves the actual project deletion into an ActiveJob job. It also introduces a 
new project status (SCHEDULED_FOR_DELETION) that is used to effectively hide
the project that is about to be deleted (and any potential descendant projects)
from the system immediately.

A security notification is sent out to the user who deleted the project,

36699,Change the text of the user link when converting @user notation to html,Mizuki ISHIKAWA,Closed,Related to #13919,"#13919 added the Mention feature to Redmine.
There are three types of notations that can be converted to user links: @@user@, @user#1@, and @user:user@. With this change, only @@user@ will have the Mention feature.

Currently, when you convert @jsmith to HTML, you get the link ""John Smith"".
I propose to change this to the following:
* Plan 1. @John Smith
* Plan 2. @jsmith(John Smith)
* Plan 3. @jsmith

Reason for change:
* The functions are different from those of other @user#1@ and @user:user@ notations and should be separated.
* I think it's important to have @ in front of the name so that people who don't know much about Redmine realize that they can use the Mention feature.

Since @jsmith has always been assumed to be converted to ""John Smith"", changing it may break the display of wiki pages and issues.

36711,Various features for MailHandler,Vincent Danjean,New,,"  Hi,

  For my local redmine instance (4.0.7-1~bpo10+1 from Debian package), I needed to improve the MailHandler behavior.
I'm sharing here my work in case it can be useful to others. Perhaps some modification might be added to official redmine, it is up to you.
I'm new in ruby, so do not hesitate to correct me if they are improvement that can be done.

  My patch add the following behaviors:

1) keep some headers in messages
  It occurs several time I've been missing some information present in the original mail. So, I added some functions to keep them (to, cc, bcc (and subject for replies))
  This is the part about headers_as_text and header_as_text
  It is my first try. All is hardcoded in the code (no option)

2) Allows one to specify the start of a line as a regexp when matching redmine keyword
  So, invoking redmine:email:receive_imap with reprefix='Redmine:? ?' forces redmine to only look at line starting with this motif (before all keywords such as Project: ...). This avoid false positive line in the mail...
  For this, there is a small modif to read the option from env and a small modif in extract_keyword! to add this prefix (and to use named match group as the prefix can add new groups '()')

3) And the biggest part: something that allows to answer to an issue without knowing the issue number.
  One of my initial goal was to be able to keep track of icinga problems in Redmine.
  Initially, I setup icinga to send notification to redmine. It works, but all messages creates new issues (either for new problems, but also for notification of fixed problem).
  So, redmine was having lots of issues, and manual work was required if we want to close issue correctly.
  I was difficult to do more things from icinga because icinga runs on a machine that cannot access to the web interface of redmine (no way for me to change this politic), so I cannot imagine icinga to look for the correct issue number (and I would not even know how to do this if the systems was on the same machine).

So, I imagine another idea. I use a specific custom field. Icinga sets up this field in all its mails, making unique by problem.
On redmine part, in the dispatch_to_default, before creating an issue, I first check if
a) the custom field is set
b) and an issue is opened with the custom field set to this value
If both conditions are present, I add a reply to the issue (instead of creating a new issue)

On redmine part, there is just an option to choose the custom field to use (ext_ref in my implementation)
On icinga, I added this kind of things in the message (it is prepared by a bash script):
<pre>
## Redmine links
cat << EOF
Redmine external reference: icinga-service: ${SERVICENAME}@${HOSTNAME}
Redmine machine: ${HOSTNAME}
Redmine service: ${SERVICENAME}

if [ ""$SERVICESTATE"" = OK ]; then echo ""Redmine Status: Terminé(e)""; fi
</pre>
  Machine and Service being to other custom fields in my tracker (and ""External Reference"" is the name of the custom field I'm using and that I give with the ext_ref='...' new parameter)

So now, new icinga problems creates new tickets. But futher notifications for the same problem (host/service) are added to the same redmine issue, until the problem is gone (""$SERVICESTATE"" = OK) that will close the ticket. If another problem occurs with the same host/service, a new ticket will be created. I a separate problem occurs with different host and/or service, another ticket will be used.

A few word about my code:
1) I'm not sure I correctly use IssueQuery. I do not find lots of examples (from ruby point of view) and I'm under the impression that the way I add the custom field filter (from its name and the searched value) is a hack.
2) I'm pretty sure that IssueQuery won't work with no_permission_check=1 (but again, I did not find any doc about the restriction on issues that IssueQuery return (visible to the current user?, ...?))
3) I needed to find a keyword (the custom field value) at the start, before the place where it will be extracted and write into the issue.
  With the initial implementation of get_keyword/extract_keyword!, the custom field value would be erased at the start, and not seen later when the issue must be updated.
  So I added a parameter to these to function that allows one to avoid to modify the message.
  It is not a proper code (extract_keyword! can be a method that do *not* modify the text, ...), it would probably need to be rewritten correctly.

And, for the end, an idea that I will perhaps implement (not yet done): two different options for allow_override: one used for new issues, one used when replying to an issue.

Even if these ideas are not added to core Redmine, I think they can be useful for other people. Having looked on Internet, I was not the only one trying to make icinga and redmine work together.
And this framework can (and will in my case) be use in other contexts:
- linking issues from redmine and another ticket system (just an idea for now, but it should be doable)
- allowing an external pipeline to create and update the good issue by mail (based on an external unique pipeline run ID)
- ...

The attached patch that was extracted from ""Planio"":https://plan.io/redmine-hosting allows to import time entries for issues across different projects.

As the term ""Principal"" is very obscure here, I propose we generally replace it with ""User or Group"".

Evaluating the code for it's adapter and model, it doesn't appear to be too dissimilar from SVN and Git's SCM.

37621,Add field separator option to CSV export dialog,Karel Pičman,Closed,,"I would like to add a field separator option to the CVS export option form.

Background:

If I have set the language e.g. to English in my Redmine profile, the separator is taken from _config/locales/en.yml_ (@general_csv_separator@) and it is *comma*. If I have installed e.g. German Microsoft Office and try to open such a CSV, it expects that the separator is *semicolon*. Unfortunately, Microsoft Office doesn't offer to choose the separator prior opening a CSV file and always uses the default value.

37807,Allow access to /robots.txt even if logins are required,Holger Just,Closed,,"Right now, if logins are globally required, the @/robots.txt@ path is not accessible for search engines since the @Welcome#robots@ path also observes this setting. Requests to @/robots.txt@ will thus receive an empty HTTP 401 in this case today.

The attached patch series improves this behavior in multiple ways. The patches were extracted from ""Planio"":https://plan.io/redmine-hosting/.

* @0001-Render-all-visible-projects-in-robots.txt-including-.patch@ - While initially not strictly related to the issue, this patch extends the list of projects included in the @/robots.txt@ to not only list active projects but also closed projects (which are still visible to anonymous). This ensures that the list is correct for cases where the Redmine does not enforce logins. Still, as the @/robots.txt@ file is intended to be consumed by search engines rather than logged-in users, we only list projects which are visible to Anonymous now. The @/robots.txt@ output thus does not distinguish between the project visibility of the current user but will only output projects visible to Anonymous.
* @0002-Always-allow-access-to-robots.txt-for-Anonymous.patch@ - This patch allows Anonymous to always access @/robots.txt@, regardless of the @Setting.login_required@ setting. Previously, this would have been denied if logins are required.
* @0003-Disallow-all-in-robots.txt-if-login-is-required.patch@ - With a required login, Anonymous should not be able to view ANY project information. Even in case some routes are manually excluded from this restriction, we still don't want those to be index by search engines. As such, with required logins, we just instruct all robots to not index anything. This patch also makes sure that we are not leaking any information about public projects in case logins are required. Before this patch (but after the previous patches), we would include a list of all public projects there, even if Anonymous could not see them without a login."

37878,Allow using ideographic space (U+3000) as a separator for search terms,Go MAEDA,Closed,,"The attached patch allows using ""　"" (ideographic space, U+3000) as a separator for search terms in addition to "" "" (U+0020).

You can perform AND searches by separating terms with a space in the search box or issue filter. Currently, ""space"" means characters that match the regular expression `\s` in this context. It is sufficient in many cases to consider `\s` as space, but not enough in some languages at least Japanese (and perhaps Chinese). This is because they use ""　"" (U+3000) when writing text, so they often mistakenly enter U+3000 instead of U+0020 when they want to separate search terms.

Actually, many services such as Google, Bing, and GitHub treat U+3000 as a separator. I think it is a small but nice improvement for those who use Redmine in languages that regularly use U+3000 if Redmine will support U+3000 as a separator for search terms."
37882,Training Tracking system or workflow,duane ellis,New,,"Q: Is it possible to create a workflow that would track training?

In general, it seems that you can assign a task (ie: go learn something)
And track that the training is completed or not completed.

Perhaps each Training item would or could be a separate Project

But - then there is expiration - ie: Every year you need to go through a refresh.
Example: Every year you need to complete a 1 hour sexual harassment training, managers have to complete a longer 2 hour one.
Example: You need an initial security training, then a yearly repeat or refresh.

I don't think there is a means to create a workflow like that where an assigned task ""expires"" or re-assigns it self after a while.

38175,remember OpenID login confirmation / continue OpenID login when not logged into redmine yet,n eeels,New,,"At osmocom.org, we have a gerrit.osmocom.org instance, where we use OpenID with our osmocom.org redmine to log in to gerrit.
The login sequence via OpenID can be extremely cumbersome, and i am seeing that every day, over and over again.
The worst case sequence I get on a daily basis is:

- on gerrit, click login (to comment on a patch for example)
- select osmocom.org as OpenID provider
- osmocom.org first wants me to log in (because i was previously not logged in)
- after login, i am not directed back to gerrit, but remain on osmocom.org redmine. other site's login procedure was aborted.
- pull up that gerrit link again -- am not logged in on gerrit yet.
- click gerrit login again
- now redmine asks me to confirm whether to share login with gerrit.osmocom.org. I have to click ""Yes"".
- only now am I logged in on gerrit.

This so much less convenient than a password manager in the browser that fills in user name and password, and i just hit enter and done.
However, our gerrit only allows OpenID login, so I am forever stuck with above sequence.

The above could improve in these two ways:

- When redmine is asked to provide an OpenID login for another site, do not drop that request when i am not logged in on redmine yet.
  So i.e. some other site requests OpenID login, then, if required, do first ask the user to log in on redmine,
  but then *continue* to complete the OpenID login on the other site.

- When I give redmine confirmation that it is ok to share the OpenID login with another site, provide a tick mark saying ""remember this choice"",
  so that i do not have to click ""Yes"" every day over again."

38226,Implement cron endpoint or script to allow calling scheduled tasks,Echedey López Romero,New,,"Hi.

I am unsure where to classify this issue because it covers a wide range of uses.

Currently, I am managing some Redmine setups over Docker based on the https://github.com/docker-library/redmine image.

Several of these setups, make impossible determining in which node the instance will run or even controlling the service in order to program calls on cron requests in the nodes to perform scheduled tasks in the instances.

Things such as reminders don't work with this setup and, even when I performed a workaround (https://github.com/docker-library/redmine/issues/64#issuecomment-1303047095), this is not ideal for high availability, as it would finish running several @cron@ instances duplicating the issue and further complexity would be added beyond reasonable to fix that with yet another workaround.

It happens that Nextcloud has 3 ways to run its internal tasks:
* Via AJAX while loading the web interface
* Via external http call using some custom service such as easyCron or your own machine to an endpoint
* Via @cron@ in the same machine

So, given this situation, I am suggesting to implement some kind of endpoint to call and execute scheduled tasks via external http calls."
38231,Limit the year to 4 digits in date input,Go MAEDA,Closed,,"Date input fields such as Start date and Due date accept up to 6 digits as a year.

The problem with this is that, for example, when the current date format is YYYY/MM/DD, the cursor automatically moves to the next DD part when a two-digit number is entered in the MM part, but not when a four-digit number is entered in the YY part. So, users should enter TAB to move the cursor from YYYY to MM. This UI inconsistency leads to erroneous input such as ""202302-01"" when you input ""2023-02-01"".

In Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, this can be improved by set `max=""9999-12-31""` to `<input type=""date"">` tags. When `max=""9999-12-31""` is set, the cursor moves from YYYY to MM immediately after you finish entering the fourth digit in YYYY. The attached patch sets `max=""9999-12-31""` to all date input fields.

The disadvantage of this patch is that you will not be able to enter a year with more than 5 digits, but this should not be a problem since I think that project management rarely deals with dates 8000 years in the future.

38263,Try importing journal replies as issue reply where applicable,Felix Schäfer,Closed,Blocks #38273,E-mails that are recognised as journal replies are currently discarded if the journal recognised from the message ID is invalid/not present anymore. This happens when a journal is deleted but may also happen when 2 redmine instances are used to send e-mails to each other.
38265,"When the user login is via 'autologin' cookiee, then the password change, and 2fa setting flow should not get triggered",Gaurav Bansal,Closed,,"Hi All,

We have added the flow of insert into the tokens table, with autologin as the cookiee. The flow is working properly if the user settings are no change password after login, 2fa disabled. But if password change is set, or 2fa is enabled, then those flow get triggered as soon as we reirect after login. Ideally if the login is via autologin flow, then these should not get triggered. So either I am doing something wrong, or this can be added as a functionality, if this is something which makes sense to the core team members."

38343,"Change the default notification option to ""Only for things I watch or I am assigned to""",Go MAEDA,Closed,"Related to #38238, Is duplicate of #39500","Currently, the default notification option of a user is ""Only for things I watch or I'm involved in"". This means that a user will receive notifications about issues of which the user is an author, assignee, or watcher. I think it would be better to change the default value to ""Only for things I watch or I am assigned to"". With the option, the user will receive notifications about issues of which the user is an assignee or watcher.

* ""Only for things I watch or I'm involved in"" (internal name is @only_my_events@): issues of which the user is an *author*, assignee, or watcher
* ""Only for things I watch or I am assigned to"" (internal name is @only_assigned@): issues of which the user is an assignee, or watcher

In Redmine 5.1, we will have ""Auto watch issues on issue creation"" feature (#38238). Since the new feature is enabled by default for newly created users, new users in Redmine 5.1 automatically become a watcher of issues they create. Becoming an issue watcher automatically means that the user will always receive notifications for issues they create even if the user's notification option is set to ""only_assigned"". Whether the setting is ""only_my_events"" or ""only_assigned"", the type of notifications received will be the same.

Given that ""only_my_events"" and ""only_assigned"" behave the same when the user's settings are left at their defaults, I think it would be better to change the default setting for email notifications (@Setting.default_notification_option@) from ""only_my_events"" to ""only_assigned"" because of the following reasons:

* Users can stop notifications of issues they created by unwatching those issues. This fulfills feature requests such as #6914 and #27135
* The behavior is confusing if ""Auto watch issues on issue creation"" is enabled and the notification setting is ""only my events"". The user will assume that the reason they receive notifications about issues they created is that they watch the issues. And if they want to stop receiving notifications, they will unwatch the issue. However, unwatching will not stop notifications when the notification setting is ""only_my_events"".

38353,Custom templates for email notifications,Jouri Mamaev,New,,"Currently email notifications is hardcoded into soources but they are not intuitive and non-usable for automation.
I want to have possibility to create filters in my mail client to sort different notifications using different rulles.

It will be nice to have customizable mail templates for subject and body in some future releases but for now I made next changes to have this for now:

* I added some templates in localization file looking like:

<pre>
  # project - project name
  # tracker - tracker name
  # id      - issue id
  # status  - issue status
  # subj    - issue title
  # from    - user made changes
  # to      - assigned to
  mail_subject_issue_new: 'ISSUE NEW: by ""%{from}"" for ""%{to}"" %{status} in ""%{project}"": %{subj}'
  mail_subject_issue_update: 'ISSUE UPDATE: by ""%{from}"" for ""%{to}"" %{status} in ""%{project}"": %{subj}'

  # no args
  mail_subject_test: 'Remine test message'
</pre>

* Changed code in ""Redmine\app\models\mailer.rb"" to use them like this:

<pre>
    s = l( ""mail_subject_issue_new"", 
           project:    issue.project.name, 
           tracker:    issue.tracker.name, 
           id:         issue.id, 
           status:     issue.status.name, 
           subj:       issue.subject,
           from:       issue.author.name,
           to:         issue.assigned_to.name )

    mail :to => user,
      :subject => s
</pre>

Now I have possibility to easy change subject templates as I need.

May be you found this way to implement this feature easy enought to add such changes.

In attachments both changed files.

38368,WebP images support in PDF output,Jun NAITOH,Closed,Related to #38168,"WebP image support has been implemented in RBPDF 1.21.1 gem.
This is a patch to support WebP images in Redmine's PDF output."
38372,Use Commonmarker instead of Redcarpet by default when rendering Markdown attachments,Mizuki ISHIKAWA,Closed,Related to #36807,"markdown_formatter returns 'common_mark' only when text_formatting is common_mark, and 'markdown' otherwise.
For example, when you attach an markdown.md file and preview it in an environment where text_formatting is Textile, the contents of the file are converted to HTML by RedCarpet('markdown').

Since RedCarpet('markdown') was deprecated in #36807, why not change markdown_formatter to return 'markdown' only when text_formatting is markdown and 'cmmon_mark' otherwise?"
38396,Support for multiple default data,kusumoto koyumi,New,,"Currently Redmine can load a single default data, but we would like to be able to select from multiple default data.
The current default data is intended for software management, but is difficult to use as is for other purposes. The system administrator needs to re-configure the tracker, status, workflow, etc., which is a hurdle for Redmine beginners.

For example, if, in addition to the current default data for software management, users could choose to load default data intended for simple task management, they would be able to quickly start using Redmine for a wider range of applications without having to perform complicated settings. It would also be possible to provide third-party default data specific to a particular use.

We request support for loading multiple default themes to simplify the initial configuration of Redmine and also to facilitate its use for a variety of purposes."
38402,"""Any searchable text"" filter for issues",Go MAEDA,Closed,"Related to #3491, Related to #10574, Related to #14943, Related to #9180, Has duplicate #680","The attached patches add a new issues filter ""Any searchable text"". Unlike existing filters that check a specific single field, this new filter checks all text-type core fields (subject, description, notes) and searchable custom fields. For example, if you apply the filter ""[Any searchable text] [contains] [recipe]”, the issues list shows issues that contain the word ""recipe"" in the subject, description, notes, or searchable custom fields. This is almost the same behavior as the search box in the upper right corner of the page. Actually, this new filter uses @Redmine::Search::Fetcher@, the code of the existing search box.

The new ""Any searchable text"" is useful when you want to find issues that contain a specific keyword but you don't know which field contains the keyword. In Redmine 5.0, you have to try one filter after another, such as ""Subject,"" ""Description,"" ""Notes"", and custom fields. With the new filter, you can find issues that contain the keyword in any of the fields in a single operation.

What is different from the search box in the upper right corner of the page is that this is a filter. This means that you can further refine the result by applying other filters such as the status, assignee, and target version.

38416,Ability to disable the priority field,Go MAEDA,Closed,"Related to #12745, Related to #35796, Related to #40860","Redmine can disable core fields such as subject, description, and assignee per tracker (#1091). However, the priority field cannot be disabled currently. The attached patch adds the ability to the priority field as well.

I have been asked many times how to disable the priority field. Since Redmine's flexible issue tracking features can be used for a wide range of purposes, there are use cases that don't need the priority field. The ability to disable the priority field will make Redmine easier to use in such use cases.

After applying the patch, You will be able to disable priority as well as other fields in the tracker's edit page. When the priority field is disabled, the default status is set for the newly created issue.

38423,Regular expression support for string/text type filters,Go MAEDA,New,Related to #13347,"I suggest adding a new operator that does regular expression matching for string/text type filters.

Currently, string or text filters such as Subject, Description, and Notes use SQL's LIKE to find objects that match the given search string. Needless to say, support for regular expressions allows for more flexible searches. Since recent versions of MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite allow regular expressions in the WHERE clause, I think it is possible to implement the new regexp operator."
38431,Add Counter to news,C S,Needs feedback,,It would be great to have a counter for the news views...
38435,"""contains any of"" operator for text filters to perform OR search of multiple terms",Go MAEDA,Closed,Related to #38446,"The attached patch adds a new operator ""contains any of"" for string/text filters and ""Any searchable text"" filter introduced by #38402. With this new operator, you can perform an OR search with multiple terms specified in single filter.

For example, if you choose the ""Subject"" filter and specify the ""contains any of"" operator and give ""close block"" as the value, issues containing either ""close"" or ""block"" in the subject will be displayed.

I believe this new OR search support in addition to the AND search added in Redmine 5.0 (#35764) will make Redmine's query system even more powerful.

"
38446,Support multiple multi-word phrases in the search engine,Go MAEDA,Closed,Related to #38435,"Currently, the search engine does not support multiple multi-word phrases.

For example, we cannot search objects that contain two phrases ""closed issue"" and ""closed version"". If you give a search string @""closed issue"" ""closed version""@, the search engine search for objects containing three strings ""closed issue"", ""closed"", and ""version"". This is due to the behavior of @Redmine::Search::Tokenizer#tokens@.

<pre><code class=""ruby"">
Redmine::Search::Tokenizer.new(%q|""closed issue"" ""closed version""|).tokens
=> [""closed issue"", ""closed"", ""version""]
</code></pre>

If the Tokenizer returns two tokens, ""closed issue"" and ""closed version"" for the same input, it will be possible to search for multiple multi-word phrases.

"
38456,"OR search with multiple terms for ""starts with"" and ""ends with"" filter operators",Go MAEDA,Closed,,"Currently, two filter operators ""contains"" and ""contains any"" support multiple terms. When multiple terms are given, those filters perform AND search or OR search.

I propose adding support for multiple terms to ""starts with"" and ""Ends with"" operators as well. If multiple terms are given, those operators will perform OR search.

Here is one of the uses of this feature. Suppose that you want to find issues with PowerPoint or PDF file attached. The result you want is the list of issues that have files whose filenames end with "".pptx"" or "".pdf"". But it is impossible to make a query to get such a result because the current ""ends with"" filter only supports a single term.

If the operator supports multiple keywords, the following filter can be applied to get the result you want.

!{width: 609px; border: 1px solid grey;}.clipboard-202304161138-0fzse.png!

The attached patch adds support for OR search with multiple terms for ""starts with"" and ""ends with"" operators. After this patch applied, all operators except ""any"" and ""none"" for string/text filters will support multiple terms."
38459,"Support ""My bookmarks"" in the search",Go MAEDA,Closed,,"The search currently doesn't yet support the option for projects ""My bookmarks"" added in Redmine 4.1.0 (#31355). The ""Project"" filter already has the option ""<< my bookmarks >>"". I think it would be nice to add ""My bookmarks"" in the search as well.

38481,Further narrow search results with issues filter,Go MAEDA,Closed,,"The attached patch adds ""Apply issues filter"" button to the search. Clicking the button will display issues in the search results on the issues page. You can further narrow the search results by adding filters on the page.

Redmine's search engine sometimes returns a large number of results. However, unlike the Issues page with its powerful filters, the search engine does not offer many ways to further refine such results. This new ""Apply issues filter"" button solves the problem.

""Apply issues filter"" will be displayed above the search results when the results include one or more issues. When you click the button, the issues included in the search results will appear on the Issues page. In other words, it converts the search results into an Issues list. You can then use issues filters to further narrow down your search results.

By linking the search engine with the issues filter, it will be easier to find the issues you want to see.

1. ""Apply issues filter"" button is displayed when the search results contain one or more issues.
!{width: 800px; border: 1px solid grey;}.clipboard-202304210006-osgl9.png!

38494,Add user with same roles | add by duplicate user roles,Fabrizio Sebastiani,New,,"When adding a new user to an existing project it would be very useful to add the user by copying the roles set from some an already existing user in the project instead of manually tag same roles one-by-one.

Looks reasonable to add a new button beside ""Edit""-""Delete"" something like ""Dup"":

* (Project) -> setting -> Members -> (select an existing user X) 
* click on new button like ""Dup"" beside ""Edit / Delete""
* the same dialog of ""New user"" is open, but it provided same roles of X already flagged on
* continue like ""New user"" use case: new names can be choosed and / or roles still changed; then confirm with ""Add"" button.

38504,Display pasted images in appropriate size on HiDPI displays,Go MAEDA,New,,"The attached patch improves the image paste feature to display images in appropriate size when you use HiDPI displays like Mac's Retina Display.

If you capture a screenshot on a HiDPI display and paste it into Redmine, the image will be displayed at twice the expected size. The image below is an example. Although the expected display size of the image is 400 x 240px, it is actually displayed at 800 x 480px. This is because the image was captured on a HiDPI display and its physical size is 800 x 480px. For me, this problem is really annoying.

!{border: 1px solid grey;}.clipboard-202304301538-efqbd.png!

After applying the patch, Redmine recognizes the pixel density of the current display when pasting an image and adds an ""@2x"" or ""@3x"" suffix to the filename (e.g. clipboard-****@2x.png) depending on the recognized value of the pixel density. With the suffix, pasted images are displayed in an appropriate size. Note that Redmine 3.4.0 and later can recognize suffixes such as ""@2x"" and ""@3x"" and adjust the display size of the image (#24922).
 
I believe this change will improve the UX when using HiDPI displays by resolving the problem that images are displayed at more than twice the size.

The image in a forum post is displayed twice as large as expected.

38853,do not disclose login account names (public projects disclose some user info),Thomas Meyer,New,,"As message#67884 did not get any reaction, I think it is worth submitting a ticket:

Following the message#51163 discussion:

We recently observed the fact that Redmine (at least until Remdmine 4.2) has the somewhat doubtable default setting that role 2 (anonymous) has the right to see all users and not only members of visible projects. I would say the latter would be a better default.

Furthermore, when there are public projects, all members of these projects are still visible to the public, together with their (login) account name, which is, in case of directory integration, their user name.

This clearly is an information that should not go to the public.

So I would suggest to

* not disclose redmine login account names to the public, even in public projects (this could probably be reached by adding a nick for public display)
* provide an option to add noindex directives to search bots for user and group information

39111,Enable Asset Pipeline Integration using Propshaft,Takashi Kato,Closed,"Related to #40137, Related to #40204, Related to #40221, Related to #40559, Related to #37748","This patch enables the Asset Pipeline in Redmine, assuming you have upgraded to Rails 7(#36320).

Until Rails 6.1, Sprockets was a prerequisite for using the Asset Pipeline. However, starting from Rails 7, ""Propshaft"":https://github.com/rails/propshaft/ has been introduced as an alternative option.
While Propshaft offers fewer features compared to Sprockets, it boasts a smaller codebase and greater clarity in its operations (eliminating the need for a JavaScript runtime). Additionally, manifest files are no longer necessary during development.

Key benefits of using Propshaft include:

* The ability to append file digests to file names instead of Rails3 stytle cache-busting approach involving query strings at the end of assets (expected to enhance cache hit rates).
* Support for tasks like copying plugin assets to the public directory each time Redmine starts.
* Compatibility with Turbo, which is almost mandatory in Rails 7 and later. (Note that Rails 7 and later deprecate rails-ujs, the current Redmine dependency.)

To address potential challenges associated with introducing Propshaft, we have extended its functionality in the following ways:

* We've made it possible for Propshaft to handle Redmine plugin and theme assets without requiring modification(If we use propshaft in default, we will need to modify the links to other assets in stylesheets.).
* We've ensured that introducing Asset Pipeline does not necessitate rewriting existing stylesheets, thus avoiding major incompatibilities with Redmine themes.
* In a production environment, rather than manually running the rails asset:precompile command before starting Rails, we now automatically check for asset updates and run precompilation as needed. (You can disable this automatic execution by setting config.assets.redmine_detect_update to false in @config/environments/production.rb@)."

39160,"Add ""Statuses"" filter when creating new ""Issue"" custom fields",Zee Prime,Needs feedback,,"Custom fields on issues can be associated with specific Trackers, so a custom field that is associated with ""Bug"" will be hidden on issues of other types.  However, if that custom field is ""required"" then it is required for every status of that issue throughout its workflow.  

In many workflows, specific pieces of information are added to an issue throughout its workflow and not all at the beginning, so it would be most useful if custom fields could reflect this.  For example, in the workflow of a ""Bug"" when the tester sets the status to ""Verified"" that tester should note the version number that they tested and the environment that they tested it in.  If a user sets the bug to ""Rejected"" they should provide an explanation for why it is rejected.

Currently, we keep all of this information in ""Notes"" and it is the responsibility of each user to remember what needs to be added based on the status they're switching from/to.  However, if we could keep this in custom fields that are selectively shown at specific points in the workflow this would both better enforce compliance and would store that information in a more structured way that we could leverage better in custom queries and reports."

39500,"Change the default notification option for users to ""Only for things I watch or I am assigned to""",Go MAEDA,Closed,Is duplicate of #38343,"Currently, the default notification option for a new user is *""Only for things I watch or I'm involved in""* (internal_name: only_my_events) . This sends notifications when any of the following conditions are met.

* The issue/object is *watched* by the user
* The issue is *created* by the user
* The issue is *assigned* to the user

I think the default option should now be *""Only for things I watch or I am assigned to""* (internal name: only_assigned) which sends notifications when any of the following conditions are met.

* The issue/object is *watched* by the user
* The issue is *assigned* to the user

This is because Redmine 5.1.0 has an auto watch for newly created issues (#38238) and the option is enabled by default for newly created users, and the behavior of the combination of auto watch and only_my_events is somewhat confusing.

Consider the following scenario:

# Admin creates a new user. The user has all auto watches enabled by default, and the email notification option is set to only_my_events
# The user creates an issue. Since all auto watches are enabled for the user, they are added as a watcher
# The user receives notifications about the issue
# The user decides they do not want to receive notifications anymore and unwatches the issue
# But the user still receives notifications because the notification option is only_my_events, and they are the author of the issue

If the default notification option is changed from only_my_events to only_assigned, this confusion will be eliminated. Here is a scenario in this case:

# Admin creates a new user. The user has all auto watches enabled by default, and the email notification option is set to only_assigned
# The user creates an issue. Since all auto watches are enabled for the user, they are added as a watcher
# The user receives notifications about the issue
# The user decides they do not want to receive notifications anymore and unwatches the issue
# The user does not receive notifications anymore because the notification option is only_assigned, and they are no longer a watcher

As illustrated above, in Redmine 5.1, the behavior is more understandable if the notification option defaults to only_assigned."

39528,Change mention link color for users without access to view issues,Mizuki ISHIKAWA,New,Related to #39529,"I propose a feature enhancement for better visibility regarding user permissions and mention notifications. Currently, when a user who does not have the permission to view a particular issue is mentioned, they do not receive a mention notification email. However, this is not visually apparent since the mention link looks identical to others, potentially leading to confusion over whether a notification was sent.

To improve clarity, I suggest altering the background color of mention links for users who cannot view the issue. This visual cue would instantly inform others that the mentioned individual may not be notified due to permission restrictions. "
39529,Add tooltips for clarifying non-notifiable user mentions,Mizuki ISHIKAWA,New,Related to #39528,"Currently, when a user without permission to view a particular issue is mentioned, they do not receive a notification email.

In issue ##39528, I proposed changing the background color of mention links for such users to make it clear they are non-notifiable. However, I believe that visual change alone may not sufficiently convey the intent to users. Therefore, I suggest using tooltips to display a message clarifying the status of the mention.
Yet, since tooltips are only used for displaying title attributes right now, expanding their use might require some discussion, which is why I have created a separate ticket for this matter."

I work with several environnements with databases which are not synchronized (so ID are différents between them, and name can evolved et be different)

I need to synchonize parts of Redmine between environnements (always in the same way environnement A -> environnement B)

For me, it's not reliable to create my synchronization on an ID or a Name, i think we should have a technical name/identifier on the objects.

So what do you think of adding an identifier at least on those elements :

- custom fields
- trackers
- workflows
- -projects (already exists)
- roles

It would be great if we had more flexibility in email setup for non registered users - I hope you can help?

Would it be possible to look at having a per project option of using default email address or custom address when sending out email alerts?

Also at present its only project members who are able to receive ticket updates, could it be possible to have a cc field in which you could specify other email address (non registered users) when making ticket updates.

These two options combined would make the workflow of ticket handling for non registered users a lot slicker.

40422,Print name and email to request that was create through email,Filip Skřivánek,New,,"We have introduced an enhancement to our email-based task creation functionality.

Traditionally, we have utilized the IMAP method for generating new tasks through emails, as detailed on the Redmine documentation page: https://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/redminereceivingemails#Fetching-emails-from-an-IMAP-server.

Due to security considerations, we opted against using the parameter unknown_user=""create"" which would automatically create a new Redmine user if the email sender wasn't recognized. Instead, we chose the unknown_user=""accept"" setting. This approach, however, resulted in tasks that seemed to be created by an anonymous user, without indicating the email sender's identity.

To address this issue, we've added a novel parameter ""insert_name_and_email_to_description"". When set to 1, this parameter ensures that the sender's name and email address are included in the first line of the task description in the format <<<[name-from-header];[email-sender]>>> as illustrated in the attached screenshot.

</code></pre>

It's important to note that the ""insert_name_and_email_to_description"" parameter is optional. If it's not set, or if its value is 0, the functionality reverts to its previous behavior.

40569,Add an option to send email notification when an attachment is added,Mizuki ISHIKAWA,Closed,,"Currently in the settings under ""Select actions for which email notifications should be sent"", if the ""Issue updated"" option is checked, an email notification is sent when an attachment is added to a issue. 
However, if the ""Issue updated"" option is unchecked, and only sub-options such as ""Note added"" or ""Status updated"" are checked, then no email notification is sent when an attachment is added.

It would be beneficial to have a separate notification setting for adding attachments, independent of other options. This would allow users to receive notifications specifically for added attachments without having to enable unrelated options. By implementing this, users can that they receive notifications tailored to their preferences, even if the ""Issue updated"" option is not selected.

It will be so nice if i am able to add an event of my own which is not ticked on my redmine. For example, release dates for the project"
40588,Ability to disable table sort,Josiah Ulfers,Needs feedback,Related to #1718,"I find the table sorting introduced by #1718 annoying because most of the tables I use are not usefully sortable and the sort as implemented can be a nuisance.

I would like an *option to turn off the JavaScript sorting globally*, that is, restore the behavior prior to #1718.

Globally might mean ""per project."" I use Redmine hosted on Planio and I'm not sure how the clients there are technically separated.

----

The specific problems are immaterial if there's an option to turn off table sorting, but I'll show the problems as motivation.

For example, I use tables like this:

|_. First group   | Gizmos A |
|_. Second        | Widgets B |
|_/2. Third       | Widgets A |
                  | Gizmos B |
|_. Fourth        | Gadgets |


Hovering table headers causes the sort arrow to appear briefly. That changes the dimensions of the cells and can cause a jarring blinking effect as the table columns resize.

It's hard to _select_ part of the text in a table cell. If I click and drag over just the word ""first"" for example, when I let up the mouse button, it sorts instead of keeping my selection. I can work around this by moving the mouse outside the cell before letting up the button, but that's easily forgotten.

Once I've sorted the table one time, often by accident as above, no amount of clicking returns it to the original order. An example table on [[RedmineTextFormattingTextile]] suffers from this problem as well.

The example table from [[RedmineTextFormattingTextile]] also shows that apparently the same sorting choice can produce different orderings.

| !{height:100px}clipboard-202404181831-c0ryh.png! | !{height:100px}clipboard-202404181833-tgair.png! |

That might be related to improper handling of row and column spans. With the simpler example here, a rowspan can rearrange cells into the wrong columns and associate them with the wrong headers.

|_. Original |_. Sorted |
| !{height:100px}clipboard-202404181812-io99s.png! | !{height:100px}clipboard-202404181812-vdkwz.png! |

#1718#note-17 lists some other potential problems.

----

Wiki syntax to disable sort per table or per column would be an alternative. Such syntax might already exist since #1718 says I can ""explicitly set the sort algorithm by adding one of the following classNames to the associated table header… sortable-keep (which keeps the row in it’s original order)."" Forgive my ignorance, but I don't know how to add classNames in wiki syntax, [[RedmineTextFormattingTextile]] doesn't mention it.

For me, however, removing JavaScript sort or a global option to turn it off would be better that fine-grained wiki syntax."

40784,Add feature to get raw Textile/Markdown text in notes and descriptions,Mizuki ISHIKAWA,New,,"There are instances where I need the raw, unprocessed text from journal comments and descriptions written in Textile or Markdown, rather than the HTML-converted information. This is particularly necessary when I want to write a new comment based on the information displayed in these formats. Additionally, there are times when I need to add information to tables written in Textile or Markdown. Without access to the raw text, I would have to recreate the table from scratch.

While it is possible to obtain the raw text from the input fields if I have editing permissions for the comments, such permissions are not always available. Another alternative is to use the quote feature, but this is not a complete solution as it adds quotation marks and can omit some of the original formatting.

The idea is to enhance the visibility and traceability of modifications related to projects. Specifically, we propose that at least the following events be included on the 'Activity' page of each project:

* Project Creation: Log the creation of new projects.
* Changes to Project Fields: Track and display changes made to project fields such as the project name, description, etc.
* Changes to Project Custom Fields: Include modifications made to custom fields associated with the project.

Each of these events should be shown with the author, date, and a diff (similar to how changes to issues and other entities are currently displayed). This feature will significantly improve the transparency and management of project changes.

Implementation Participation:

If this feature request is approved, we are ready and willing to participate in its implementation. We seek guidance and support from core developers to ensure our contributions align with Redmine’s standards and best practices.

We believe this addition will be valuable for many users and look forward to collaborating with the Redmine development team to bring this enhancement to life.

41031,Include project identifier in List-Id header field of notification emails,Go MAEDA,Closed,Is duplicate of #13359,"I propose adding the project identifier to the @List-Id@ header field of notification emails. Currently, the @List-Id@ is based on the emission email address (@Setting.mail_from@). I want to change the List-Id to include both the project identifier and the emission email address.

The current notification email headers include the @X-Redmine-Project@ field, which contains the project identifier. However, widely used email services Gmail do not support filtering based on custom headers starting with @X-@. This makes it difficult to create filters based on the project.

By including the project identifier in the @List-Id@, users can utilize Gmail’s @list@ operator to create filters based on the project. This enhancement would improve the ability to organize and manage project-related emails in Gmail.


*Current Implementation:*
For an emission email address of @redmine@example.net@, the current List-Id is:

<pre>
List-Id: <redmine.example.net>
</pre>

*Proposed Implementation:*
For an emission email address of @redmine@example.net@ and a project identifier of @ecookbook@, the proposed List-Id is:

<pre>
List-Id: <ecookbook.redmine.example.net>
</pre>

*Backward Compatibility:*

Changing the @List-Id@ header field value will affect users who depend on the current format. To address this, we may need to add a new setting in Administration > Settings page allowing users to choose whether to include the project identifier in the List-Id. This ensures that existing workflows relying on the current List-Id format remain unaffected.

Is there an option that the Status automatically switch to a 'closed' issue Status?

The reason is simple:
* I don't want to modify always to fields in the issue
* the Overview remains issues that are already solved

It would be great if somebody has an idea."
41202,Change the default CSV export encoding to UTF-8,Go MAEDA,Closed,,"This patch changes the default encoding for CSV exports from @:general_csv_encoding@ to UTF-8.

UTF-8 is now the standard encoding format and is crucial for exporting data with multiple languages or Unicode emojis to prevent character corruption. Therefore, using UTF-8 is the best choice in most cases.

Currently, Redmine defaults to @:general_csv_encoding@ (ISO-8859-1 for English, CP932 for Japanese) for CSV exports, requiring users to manually select UTF-8 each time, which is inconvenient. Switching the default to UTF-8 will simplify this process.

The default was originally set to @:general_csv_encoding@ for compatibility with older versions of Excel, which didn’t support UTF-8. However, modern Excel versions can read UTF-8 encoded CSV files with a BOM. Since Redmine’s UTF-8 exports include a BOM (see #7037), changing the default to UTF-8 will not affect Excel compatibility.

41203,RGPD Compliance,YoZ Art,Closed,Related to #28882,"I'm trying to figure out how to be RGPD compliant in Redmine.

When you delete a user, it will set everything own by this user as ""Anonymous"". Anonymyzing data is a way of being RGPD compliant but I can't delete all users obviously.

Instead of that, I would like to have a feature that will anonymize everything which is older than XXX months.

Do you see a way of doing it ? I dind't found any plugin, nor existing feature in Redmine. Is it something planned ? That you are discussing about ?

Otherwise, any idea how I can perform this (in SQL maybe - do you have a table/field list that I can use to perform this ?)"
